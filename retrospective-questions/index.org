From Llewellyn Falco:

#+begin_quote
I usually start with the 1st layer: PETTDLES

- pattern
- emotions
- tools
- team
- domain
- language
- events
- surprises

Then ask for observations. I do the grouping based on what is said

Context:
I like doing retrospectives, but asking "what's good and what's bad?" isn't giving me as good results as I'd like.
