#+TITLE: Utility is Contextual

[[file:..][..]]

Shamelessly stolen from Zach Tellman of https://ideolalia.com/.

Premise / my interpretation: it's useless to judge utility abstracted from context.

I suggest we separate our statements between definitions and experience reports.
A definition defines a concept as crisply as possible.
An experience report applies a set of definitions to a problem, shares the effects, and judges their desirability.

Don't push an abstraction on your friends without qualification.
Rather, when you want to introduce an abstraction, consider why it's useful.
Build up a nexus of examples.
Then ask your friends to make their own judgement.
