;; # CLJ-Kondo hooks for application programmers

;; Macros are a powerful tool that can cause confusion and tears.

;; Static analysis with CLJ-Kondo can help tame that confusion and avoid those tears.
;; Let's learn about just that.

;; ## Kondo knows certain macros

;; Take the `for` macro:

(for [n (range 10)]
  (- n))

{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :fold :result :hide}}

(do
  (require '[clojure.repl]
           '[nextjournal.clerk :as clerk])

    `(clerk/html [:pre (with-out-str (clojure.repl/doc ~sym))]))
  (defmacro doc [code]
    (doc* code)))

{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :show}}

;; Your REPL knows it.

(doc for)

;; What about this sillyness?

(defmacro i-laugh-at-your-two-parameters
  "Laugh at two parameters, hopelessly ignored."
  [x y] "lol")

(doc i-laugh-at-your-two-parameters)

;; `doc` knows it.
;; Next example.

(defmacro deflaughing
  [sym & body]
  (println "I laugh at your petty" sym
           ", created from the woefully inadequate" body)
  `(def ~sym (do ~@body)))

(defmacro capture-out [& body]
  `(clerk/html [:pre (with-out-str ~@body)]))

;; Under macroexpansion, this macro will laugh in your face.

(capture-out (macroexpand '(deflaughing the-number-after-one-and-two (+ 1 2))))

;; But CLJ-Kondo does not understand your macro!

(deflaughing laugh-all-you-want (+ 1 2))

;; ## Kondo analyze hooks
;;
;; Kondo can be taught to know new macros through hooks.
;; Their reference is [doc/hooks.md] (in the Kondo repo).
;;
;; [doc/hooks.md]: https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/hooks.md

;; Hooks work on a custom type tailored to represent Clojure code.
;; Plain symbols and Clojure data structures because it doesn't keep track of location data: which column, which line.

(str node)

;; bingo.
;; Now we can get our delicious Clojure data structures back.

(read-string (str node))

;; which does the same as the built-in `sexpr`.

(hooks/sexpr node)

;; Okay, nice.
;; How do we build support for our new macro?
;; The API docs give us a clue:
;;
;; > It is not important that the code is rewritten exactly according to the
;; > macroexpansion. What counts is that the transformation rewrites into code
;; > that clj-kondo can understand.
;;
;; Nice!
;; Our task is to rewrite the code into code that Kondo *can* understand.
;;
;; Let's try expand `(deflaughing x (+ 1 2))` into `(def x (+ 1 y))`.

;; first a macro.

(defmacro defgrinning [sym & body]
  (println (str sym "üòÅ"))
  `(def ~sym (do ~@body)))

(with-out-str (macroexpand '(defgrinning x 33)))

;; Then a hook!

;; The hooks documentation specifies that hooks must live in the .clj-kondo directory, so we do just that.

(clerk/code (slurp ".clj-kondo/hooks.clj"))

;; We hook up the hook with config binding macro var to hook var.

(clerk/code (slurp ".clj-kondo/config.edn"))

(defgrinning x "it's fine ...")
