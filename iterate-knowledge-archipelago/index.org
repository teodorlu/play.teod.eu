** Who should I ask for help?
Richard? Nils? Henrik? Andreas? Mats?
** What should I ask for?
*** Guest content on play.teod.eu?
*** Ask them to create their own stuff?
*** Contribute "views" on content that follows the Iterate Knowledge Archipelago Protocol?
IKAP haha

Or just Iterate Knowledge Protocol - IKP
* 2022-06-30
Initial call to action to start building our knowledge archipelago.
* 2022-07-01
Lobbied heavily for people to take part
* 2022-07-02
** I want:
1. Separate islands of content
2. A collaboratively worked-on index into the system
   1. Ask Ole Jacob to help?
   2. Can it be just frontend?
      1. Redeploy to register new sites
      2. cache index in indexeddb/ localstorage
      3. refresh index on each new page load
   3. Consider having it work with Iterbart
** Possible process name: bottom-up knowledge synthesis
Me likey.
** Efforts at "writing things down" commonly fail because of:
1. Prematurely putting things into large hierarchies
2. The inability to critique the hierarchy itself --- and iterate on the hierarchy
3. The inability to have separate hierarchies
4. More abstractly --- we need a /fractal/ structure, not a hierarchical one.
5. Poor authority separation
6. Bad effects from intermixing drafts and completed stuff
7. Hard to find the good stuff
8. Hard to search --- index
9. Hard to build views
10. Hard to embed small things we'd want to share
** How/who should I ask for help?
Richard? Nils? Henrik? Andreas?

Well, everyone, really. People bring stuff to the table.

But --- it's easier to help if you're asked about something specific.
Where --- specifically --- can I ask for help?

I can ask Ole Jacob to help design an UI / view for the collected works of everyone.
I can ask Richard for content.

Which things should I ask for?
* 2022-07-17
Asked Richard if he wanted to publish own stuff or publish stuff on play.teod.eu.
