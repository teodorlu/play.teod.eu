#+TITLE: execution for developers

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

What does "chief executive" mean?
My opinion: The person with ultimate responsibility for a good outcome.

*Execution*:

- are the overall priorities right?
- are we doing the right things to hit the overall priorities?

*Execution for developers*.

- what things should I be making progress on today?
- have I made progress on the things I should today?

*a process has a job to be done*.
if you don't know a process's job to be done, you

1. Either haven't done your job as a leader building strategic context,
2. or the process should should be stopped.

As a leader, you need to know why things are being done.

This is a burden, but also a fine way to judge /everything/.
If you know /why/ initiatives are worked on, you can judge whether the initiative works as it should.

*the job to be done for a meeting* TODO

Could ask for feedback from Dan Krister.
