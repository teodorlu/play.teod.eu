<h1 class="title">What‚Äôs a good intersection between work and play?</h1>
</header>
<p><a href="..">..</a></p>
<p>Play is dynamic, work is static. That‚Äôs how I view it.</p>
<p>When we play, we move in surprising ways. Imagine a playground with a
dozen eight-year-olds. What‚Äôs going to happen in half an hour? Can you
tell? How about in ten minutes?</p>
<p>When we play, we let our mind wander. We ease some constraints.</p>
<p>Finding a good balance between work and play is important. I see it
as a design challenge. I touched on this in 2018 as <a
href="../static-dynamic-interaction/">Static-dynamic interaction</a>,
and frankly, I can‚Äôt get the topic out of my head. It‚Äôs stuck. When I
least expect it, it jumps back at me with a ‚Äúpikaboo‚Äù.</p>
<p>Play alone is not enough. Just work will suck all air out of an
initiative. We need both work and play, and we need a balance.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been enjoying <a href="../metamuse-podcast/">Metamuse
(podcast)</a> lately. Today I was listening to Episode 27: <a
href="https://museapp.com/podcast/27-playful-software/">Playful software
with Rasmus Andersson</a>. I had to stop listening when I heard this
(edited for brevity):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rasmus:</p>
<p>What boundaries do we need to define? Let‚Äôs say we have a couple of
smart, interesting, playful people. The company people recognize that,
and say:</p>
<p>‚ÄúHey Lisa and Robin, would you be interested in sitting in this
corner just coming up with crazy shit? Maybe we‚Äôll ship it.‚Äù</p>
<p>I think in most cases, that‚Äôs a failure.</p>
<p>Maybe the constraints are way too vague. Similar to an art class. Ask
someone to paint <em>anything they want</em>, and you get paralysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much can go wrong when the interaction between work and play is
accidental. Here are some examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>situation</th>
<th>example failure</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>a group of people are only playing</td>
<td>their play never helps us ship anything</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>one person is playing, another is working</td>
<td>horrible experience for the worker. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your Nanny, I‚Äôve got
shit to do‚Äù</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>a group of people are only working</td>
<td>no creativity at work.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I‚Äôve worked on <a href="../unicad/">Unicad</a> in its current shape
for about two years. We‚Äôve seen lots of traction and I greatly enjoy
working with my co-founder, so my go-to answer to ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù is
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be more happy‚Äù. But lately, something has been bugging
me.</p>
<p>We have three major work streams right now:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>stream</th>
<th>what</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>usability</td>
<td>is the product ergonomic in daily use?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>sales</td>
<td>are more people interested in the current value proposition?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>value</td>
<td>are we able to handle more valuable workflows?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the last six months, we‚Äôve been solely focused on usability. I‚Äôve
taken a something of a technical product manager domain expert sales
person role. Because my co-founder is <em>very</em> strong
technically.</p>
<p>But where‚Äôs the play? I like coding because it‚Äôs playful. Call it a
hunch. Lack of play limits creativity.</p>
<p>At least I‚Äôve been reasonable.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve taken care of usability and sales. Mostly practicalities. But
the high risk high reward value work? That‚Äôs been on hold.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, where‚Äôs the actionable insight? Are you just rambling, Teodor
‚Ä¶</p>
<p>This is where ‚Äúwork‚Äù asks us to be specific. Perhaps because <a
href="../utility-is-contextual/">Utility is Contextual</a>? Perhaps work
is to provide utility in a context.</p>
<span style="font-size: 90pt">
ü§îüßå
</span>

<p>Parting words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absence of play kills motivation and creativity</li>
<li>Absence of work disconnects you from reality</li>
<li>I think there‚Äôs a correlation between propensity to treat work as
play and being a strong contributor at work</li>
<li>I think everyone deserves a bit of play, and <em>also</em> deserves
the responsibility to do proper work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Have a good one,</p>
<p>Teodor</p>

<p><strong>Appendix B: Proposed definitions for <em>work</em> and
<em>play</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>play is unpredictable</strong>. When we play, we can‚Äôt
predict where we will end up in advance. That‚Äôs where the excitement
comes from :)</p>
<p><strong>when we work, there is a deliverable</strong>. Effective
people know how to anchor their efforts so their effort add value in a
context. And they keep that context in mind during the work, not as an
afterthought. See <a href="../utility-is-contextual/">Utility is
Contextual</a> and <a href="../theres-always-a-deliverable/">There‚Äôs
always a deliverable</a>.</p>
<p>I also think it‚Äôs possible to orient a product team around
<em>both</em> work and play. Early draft for a work process: <a
href="../oggpow/">OGGPOW: A non-coercive strategic framework</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix C: programming as play</strong></p>
<p>Oddmund kindly suggested I look into <a
href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/programmingasplay.html">Programming
as play</a>.</p>
<p>The author, Austin Z. Henley refers further to an academic paper: <a
href="https://static.barik.net/barik/publications/vlhcc2017/PID4950171.pdf">Expressions
on the Nature and Significance of Programming and Play</a></p>
