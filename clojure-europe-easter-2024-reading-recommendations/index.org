#+TITLE: Easter 2024 reading recommendations from the European Clojure community: from WW1 history to implementing logic programming in Scheme

[[file:..][..]]

* Notes

#+begin_quote
If you are into sci-fi and have not read them yet, I definitely recommend Dan Simmons’ Hyperion cantos.

For papers, the micro kanren paper, mini kanren thesis, and logitT paper are gems. Byrd's unified approach to solving problems (functional pearl) is a pearl :slightly_smiling_face:

If you're more practically inclined, Armstrong's thesis and Hoar's CSP paper & book

Pitching in with sci fi - three body problem, and haven't read it yet but it's on The List, Book Of The New Sun

If you like traumatizing books, Malazan Book of The Fallen series is highly recommended

Also, it's always a good day to reread Dune

If you're into 40k, Ciaphas Cain or Eisenhorn series

Warhammer 40k books can be fun terrible misses. I'd avoid the Horus Heresy series, but the setting is rich and engaging and is a good bed for good individual storytelling. Ciaphas Cain is light hearted and a good place to start

A very recent (for me) and very pleasing sci fi read/listen I had were the Ancillary books by Anne Leckie, starting with Ancillary Justice.
Was quite blown away by it.
Funny thing: I finished the 4th book in that universe today and just found this Google Talk Leckie gave about it 6 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sapIgYyzAYs

If you like Fantasy in a historical setting (Ireland in the viking age around 900 or 1000), I enjoyed The Children of Gods and Fighting Men by Shauna Lawless

And then, if you want some non-fictional and non-tech, I re-read Guns of August by Barbara W. Tuchman, a classic about the start of the first world war. First time I read it was almost 20 years ago, it hit me harder this time around and it’s really gripping. (edited)

If you’re into history, two of the best I’ve read in the past couple of decades are The Prize by Daniel Yergin - tells the story of the advent of the oil economy, and Dark Sun by Richard Rhodes - the story of the Atomic Bomb. Both great reads. Rising Sun by John toland (story of imperial Japan immediately before and during WWII) also a page turner.

- Lem’s Cyberiad for amazing sci-fi that’s also very funny.
- Lamport’s clock sync paper https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf
- History: 2nd vote for Guns of August, which feels particularly apropos right now
