Marty Cagan has written two books I've really enjoyed:

| book      | topic                                          |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------|
| [[https://www.svpg.com/books/empowered-ordinary-people-extraordinary-products/][Empowered]] | Product teams and the job of a product manager |
| [[https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/][Inspired]]  | Product teams                                  |

heh.
"are they about the exact same thing?"
Not really.

There's also a third book from the same "gang":

| book  | topic                         |
