Scope, copied from first slide:

#+begin_verse
*Objective - Demystify Design*

    not (just) going to the hammock
    practice - ‘what you do’

concrete techniques with tangible outputs
demonstrable progress ‘walk forward’
activities you can make PM stories out of

    thus make time for, throughout the dev process
    not pleading for 2 weeks of nebulous 'hammock time' up front

valuable artifacts that make the effort evident

tips and techniques, not a formal method or anything highfalutin
#+end_verse
