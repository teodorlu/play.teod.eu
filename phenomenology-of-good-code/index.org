#+TITLE: The Phenomenology of Good Code

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Idea: use [[id:6ac830ef-cb3f-48ea-924a-5304384c4b8e][phenomenology]] as a tool to judge the quality of code.

Good experience working with the code?
Good code!
Bad experience working with the code?
Bad code!

Caveat: people's experiences differ.

Who are on the team?
What are they familiar with?

When the experience working with code is poor, should the code be changed, or does the programmer need to learn something?

(inspired by a comment on /ergonomics/ by [[id:8833ff2f-ed66-4db2-ac14-6f8eff9f70d4][Oddmund]])
