#+TITLE: Product owner, project manager, product leader

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

In what ways to the responsibilities of a product owner, a project manager and a product leader overlap, and in what ways are they different?

* A product owner prioritizes the backlog
Scrum trifecta: product owner, scrum manager and development team.
* A project manager limits WIP
* A product leader does what needs to be done.
What needs to be done when developers and designers do an excellent job in their roles?



Terminology footnote: What I refer to as a product leader might be called a product manager by others.
* WIP vs options
* Limit WIP, create, curate and priotitize options.
