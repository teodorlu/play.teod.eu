#+TITLE: Writing is fake

[[file:..][..]]

I write less than I used to.
A snarkiness grips me sooner.
Perhaps I'm getting old.
Perhaps something in me is saying no.
Or perhaps writing simply is fake.
The act of soaring in the skies, disconnected from the world.
Pretend play.
Mental gymnastics for the sake of itself.
Self centered, ignorant.
Devoid of texture.
