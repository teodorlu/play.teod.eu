#+title: Opt-in hierarchies

[[./..][..]]

State: DRAFT / INCOMPLETE

Idea - "monohierarchical" approaches are sticky, and often bad. Humans
understand things in terms of hierarchies. This understanding is often copied
straight over to organization.

An alternative approach is to organize things in flat structures, and instead
present a hierarchy as a mental model when that's useful.

In the long run, this increases agility. It's easier to change both the
organization (due to its flatness) and the hierarchies, because the hierarcies
are views.
