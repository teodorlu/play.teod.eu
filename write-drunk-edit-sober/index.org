#+TITLE: Write drunk, edit sober

[[file:..][..]]

Examples:

When writing text, first write too much, then edit.
Why?
Because it's faster, better.
Your mind can /first/ be in positive, constructive mode, then pick at all the flaws later.

When building product, propose and share the idea first, the criticize reality later.
This is what feature flags are for.
Write the idea out in its full form (text, working feature under a flag), /then/ test and measure whether it's any good.

*why?* Because the boundaries of ideas are fuzzy, and the act of expanding the fuzziness (writing) is totally different from the act of removing all that is fuzzy (editing).

/who said that?/
I know that I just read it.
It appears Hemingway said something /like it/.
You can also try the [[id:5baabeb7-f920-416c-941e-edbbd156f805][dangerous writing app]].
It deletes your text if you try to stop writing and start editing too early.
