<h2 id="in-theory-this-should-work.">‚ÄúIn theory, this should work.‚Äù</h2>
<p>I heard this the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In theory, this should work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me: üò±</p>
<p>No, <code class="verbatim">:face_screaming_in_fear:</code> isn‚Äôt
quite right, this isn‚Äôt fear. Perhaps it‚Äôs anguish. Or shame. Or
sorrow.</p>
<p>To me, ‚ÄúIn theory, this should work‚Äù denigrates and destroys the
notion of theory. ‚Äútheory‚Äù as a notion of practice that might not
work.</p>
<p>We have other words to denote uncertainty!</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúI think this might work‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúI want to try this‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúI think this solves your problem‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs perfectly fine, very common and super useful to make the things
you don‚Äôt understand explicit. Saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how SQLite works‚Äù
names the problem, and makes it easier to understand SQLite later.
You‚Äôve now moved turned an unknown unknown into a known unknown.</p>
<h2
id="good-theory-explains-things-well-has-wide-reach-and-is-hard-to-vary">Good
theory explains things well, has wide reach and is hard to vary</h2>
<p>So if theory is <em>not</em> ‚Äúthings that don‚Äôt work in practice‚Äù,
what is theory?</p>
<p>I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A theory has explanatory power</strong>. All other things
being equal, a theory that explains better than a different theory is
better.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A theory has reach</strong>. A theory explains things
within some domain. That is the <em>reach</em> of the theory. All other
things being equal, a theory with larger reach than a different theory
is better.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A good theory is hard to vary</strong>. If you can change
arbitrary parts of your theory, and it still <em>holds</em>, the theory
is too big. Something can probably be removed. And removing that thing
will make the theory <em>better</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="good-practice-gives-you-the-results-you-need">Good practice
gives you the results you need</h2>
<p>Good practice produces a result. If that result is what you need, the
practice works.</p>
<p>A practice is better than a different practice if it produces better
results.</p>
<h2 id="bad-goals">Bad goals</h2>
<p>Where do you want to go? If you don‚Äôt know, you probably won‚Äôt end up
there. If you don‚Äôt know where you want to end up, your goals aren‚Äôt
good enough. If you don‚Äôt know why you did the things you did the last
two months, your goals aren‚Äôt good enough.</p>
<h2 id="bad-practice">Bad practice</h2>
<p>If the things you do don‚Äôt get you where you want to go, you have bad
practice.</p>
<h2 id="bad-theory">Bad theory</h2>
<p>Is what you‚Äôre doing clear? Or is everything hard to describe?</p>
<p>Do you know what you did for the last two months? Or did you get
where you wanted, but you have no idea what you did?</p>
<p>The act of <em>building theory</em> clears things up. Makes things
easier to understand.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can even apply known theory and known terminology that
somebody else made.</p>
<h2 id="which-theory">Which theory?</h2>
<p>Back to the source of our frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In theory, this should work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, which theory???</p>
<p>Theories make things clear by making things <em>explicit</em>. If you
<em>do</em> want to talk about theory, at least let others know
<em>which theory</em> you are referring to. Because there are infinitely
many to pick from, and possibly not obvious to others which one you
meant.</p>
<p>Or, you can choose to <em>not</em> talk about theory! That is
perfectly fine. ‚ÄúMy goal is to display the current time in the CET
timezone. Can you help me achive that?‚Äù No theory required to ask that
question!</p>
<h2 id="good-goals-then-good-practice-then-good-theory">Good goals, then
good practice, then good theory</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going, perhaps you should work on
your goals.</li>
<li>If you aren‚Äôt getting to where you want to get, perhaps you should
work on your theory.</li>
<li>If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, perhaps you should work on your
theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cities need water. From what we know about Rome‚Äôs population in 200BC
we could estimate a required water supply. Aqueducts were built, and
still stand. In the middle ages, engineers understood how effective arch
shapes for building build cathedrals. Today, we have <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics">continuum
mechanics</a>, a theory that explains arches, and more. Continuum
mechanics lets us simulate the behavior of our arch, and observe the
structural response before we build our arc:</p>

<p>Software engineering is a young field. We don‚Äôt yet agree on our
shared foundation. <a href="../marty-cagan/">Marty Cagan</a> style
product management gives one approach to goals, continuous delivery
gives approach to practice, and functional programming gives one
approach to theory. But this is seen as <em>one approach</em>. We
haven‚Äôt built a shared foundation, yet.</p>
<p>Perhaps the next 50 years of software engineering will change that?
I‚Äôm eager to find out.</p>
<p>‚ÄîTeodor 2024-06-17</p>
<p>PS. My notion for theory is stolen from <a
href="../david-deutsch/">David Deutsch</a>. I whole-heartedly recommend
reading his book <a href="../the-beginning-of-infinity/">The Beginning
of Infinity</a>. This guy is great at explaining things, knows quantum
physics in depth and knows epistemology in depth. In other words, he‚Äôs
quite good at theory, both in theory (epistemology) and in practice (how
quantum physics helps us understand reality). He‚Äôs a person worth
learning from.</p>
<p>PPS. Design documents and tests can be the foundation for your theory
for your codebase. They can help explain. But if you start out by
assuming they are useless, they will become useless. If you intend to
explain the codebase in the README and with tests, you need to use the
README and use the tests in practice. Re-read the README in a moment of
uncertainty. Does something need to be added? Run and read the tests to
understand how things are meant to work. Then add tests for the new code
you‚Äôre adding too.</p>
