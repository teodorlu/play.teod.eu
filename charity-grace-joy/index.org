A thing I had to learn.

*Charity*: someone has to take the first step.
Consider doing just that.

*Grace*: others are not perfect.
You are not perfect.
Accept that.

*Joy*: finally, enjoy the moment, and enjoy the process!

/as principles for interacting with others/.
Treat other persons with grace, not as objects.
Take the first step.
Then, when possible, remember that you're allowed to enjoy the experience!
