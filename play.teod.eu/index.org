https://play.teod.eu/

Yeah, the page on play.teod.eu on play.teod.eu.
Kind of weird, right?

Whether this is "a remote reference" or not is up for discussion.

:)

I think I want to merge [[id:b722664c-d310-4908-9b57-98ffd73833c9][play.teod.eu: Rolling retrospective]] into this page.
I'm using remote references /as direct commentary/ on for example [[id:dde82bbc-e4c8-49c0-b577-dba0cba0bdf7][The Beginning of Infinity]], and I really like that.
Rich references.
Mmmmm.
