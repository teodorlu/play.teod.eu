DRAFT

BEWARE: THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT YET EXIST!

You are reading my working notes.

** CLI draft
#+begin_src
# To open a link:
$ bink
# Select link with fzf
# Then it's opened in your browser.

# Add a link
$ bink add "Clojure Deref" https://clojure.org/news/news
#+end_src
** Nice to have: link providers
Nice to have / later: link providers.
I could fetch links from multiple sources.
Use one source with my team at work.
Another for personal stuff.

A link provider could be an EDN file, a JSON file, an SQLite DB, an URL or a system command.

But! Let's not start there.
Or ...
It would be nice to be able to just symlink multiple files / programs into ~/.local/share/bink/providers.d/

Hmmm.
** Config
| Path                        | Purpose                      |
|-----------------------------+------------------------------|
| =~/.config/bink/config.edn= | Bink main configuration file |
| =~/.config/bink/provider/*= | Additional link providers    |
** Link providers
JSON file - interpret as JSON.
EDN file - interpret as EDN.

What about programs?
If they are executable, perhaps they should be run?

Perhaps an executable =links.json= should output JSON links on stdout.

** Link file format
EDN:

#+begin_src clojure
{:links [{:title "Clojure Deref" :href "https://clojure.org/news/news"}
         {:title "Clojureverse" :href "https://clojureverse.org/"}]}
#+end_src

JSON:

#+begin_src json
{
    "links": [
        {"title": "Clojure Deref", "href": "https://clojure.org/news/news"},
        {"title": "Clojureverse", "href": "https://clojureverse.org/"}
    ]
}
#+end_src
