#+TITLE: Systems Thinking - Notes and Resources, by Robert Stuttaford

[[file:..][..]]

https://rostnl.notion.site/

Why is this interesting?

1. I'm interested in "sociotechnological systems" -- especially commentary by folks open to discussing, not just wanting people to read their book
2. The use of "Notion as knowledge base" is interesting
   1. Note - he also has a website.
      So I assume Notion is better for "getting things done" for him than just using the website for everything.
      And I assume he keeps the website so that he can control the layout completely.
