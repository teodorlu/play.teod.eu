</header>
<p><a href="..">..</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve done a lot of things I’m proud of, but
I feel like it’s been too much at the same time. The last two weeks,
I’ve been on the other side of the spectrum. I <em>don’t</em> have too
much to do. I <em>can</em> do the things I should in a reasonable
pace.</p>
<p>A part of me stuttered. Shouldn’t there be more stuff going on?
Shouldn’t I be busier?</p>
<p>I’ve made a conscious effort to calm this tendency. Not having too
much is <em>fine</em>.</p>
<p>This experience got me asking <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>I have a few things I’d like to achieve. I have goals I want to
reach. Outcomes to accomplish. Over time, however, I don’t think
accomplishing outcomes should be the only motivating factor: I need to
find meaning in the process too The way there. The path we’re going; the
path we’re making for ourselves.</p>
<p>Which is where I’m at right now. A part of me keeps pushing for
ambition. Just do it! Or, more realistically, “Just start that other
initiative too!”. Because the drive is to <em>start</em>. And when we
ruthlessly follow the drive to <em>just start</em>, we risk <em>not
finishing</em>.</p>
<p>Counterintuitively, for me, it’s easier to finish things when I don’t
hold the goal so tightly in mind. I can give myself room to think
<em>after</em> I’ve done a piece of work. Reflect on its impact. Tweak
it a bit.</p>
<p>Another piece of the lesson is working with great people. I’m
currently working with great people. That gives me room to breathe. It
<em>will be okay</em> if I don’t push with all my weight all week. I can
trust the others to do their part. I can contribute to their stated
goals. Sit in the back seat, pay attention to what the others are
doing.</p>
<p>I’ve written about <a href="../learning-to-play-support/">learning to
play support</a> before. Sometimes it’s better to aim to be helpful than
try run the show. The core of this is what I wanted to convey in <a
href="../support-challenge-carry/">support, challenge, carry</a>.
Support is to help, to challenge is to pull intent apart for analysis,
and to carry is to create intent. I do believe that in the best teams,
the carry changes over time.</p>
<p>I write the following in <em>support, challenge, carry</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>dynamic initiative</strong>. Who should carry? That depends
on who knows the territory better – what we’re doing now, and where
we’re going. As a team forms, its <a
href="../trust-quality-intent/">turst, shared sense of quality, and
shared intent</a> will improve. That lowers switching costs. Questions
&amp; framings that needs to be explicit early on takes hold in a shared
understanding. With lower switching cost, it makes sense to move the
initiative around. When the switching cost reaches zero, we want the
player with the best map to lead. But can we reach “perfection”? No. I
don’t believe that’s possible. There will <em>always</em> be information
asymmetry. The reason is plain: information asymmetry gives teams
leverage. Different people want different things.</p>
<p>Not: <em>perfect dynamic initiative</em>. But: <em>shared
understaning, charity and team willingness to support, challenge and
carry</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still believe that a dynamic initiative is the best solution for a
team.</p>
<p>So perhaps this is all ego? Or mostly ego, and a tinge of me wanting
to keep carry-skills I’ve built from going dull?</p>
<p>I do believe our current direction is exactly where we need to go. I
am happy with the two last weeks of work, even if my contributions
weren’t essential for what we got done. And I am even more happy with
the fact that our work doesn’t stink of stressful reactions to every
irrelevant movement of nearby leaves. After all, our team doubled in
size a month ago, and we probably will have to make an effort to find a
rhythm that works for us.</p>
<p>One model I’ve seen referenced is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman&#39;s_stages_of_group_development">Tuckman’s
stages of group development</a>. From the Wikipedia page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The forming–storming–norming–performing model of group development
was first proposed by Bruce Tuckman in 1965,[1] who said that these
phases are all necessary and inevitable in order for a team to grow,
face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and
deliver results. He suggested that these inevitable phases were critical
to team growth and development. This series of developmental stages has
become known as the Tuckman Ladder.</p>
<p>Tuckman hypothesized that along with these factors, interpersonal
relationships and task activity would enhance the four-stage model that
he first proposed as needed to successfully navigate and create an
effective group function.[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not entirely clear to me what differentiates the phases from
each other. What, exactly, is forming, storming, norming and performing?
Here’s a brief summary of the Wikipedia page:</p>
<dl>
<dt>forming</dt>
<dd>
<p>the team and its objective is defined. Members behave independently,
but try to make good impressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To grow from this stage to the next, each member must relinquish the
comfort of non-threatening topics and risk the possibility of
conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>storming</dt>
<dd>
<p>x</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gain trust</p></li>
<li><p>voice opinions</p></li>
<li><p>hierarchy, status &amp; power</p></li>
<li><p>suspicion, fear and anxiety</p></li>
<li><p>Wikipedia includes this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this stage “participants form opinions about the character and
integrity of the other participants and feel compelled to voice these
opinions if they find someone shirking responsibility or attempting to
dominate. Sometimes participants question the actions or decision of the
leader as the expedition grows harder”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… which I (quite frankly) find America-centric. At least, this does
not reflect anything I’ve seen in Norway.</p>
<p>The quote is indeed from an American book: <em>Leadership the Outward
Bound Way: Becoming a Better Leader in the Workplace, in the Wilderness,
and in Your Community</em>, published by “Outward Bound USA”, with a
foreword from Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>(… and now, I (quite surprisingly, if you ask me) feel the need to
read just that book. Its table of contents. I digress. Let’s dig in!
Digressions is what this page is for.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Outline for Leadership the Outward Bound
Way</strong></strong> - with some comments of my own interspaced <em>in
italics</em>.
<ul>
<li>part I: leadership fundamentals
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1. Why learn leadership from Outward Bound?
<ul>
<li><em>I suspect this is mostly a tale of bragging? Why we should trust
these guys, a list of famous stuff they’ve done, etc.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 2. Becoming a leader.
<ul>
<li><em>Curious about this one. I expect some storytelling? Probably
interesting.</em>.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>You’ve got me now! More interesting.</em></li>

<li><em>😁. That’s my face of anticipation.</em></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Unfortunately, this book is not available on Kindle. Bah. Not sure
if I’m bought in to the degree that I want a paper copy. Maybe I can get
hold of a PDF.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>norming</dt>
<dd>
<p>relative to forming, it appears that people are getting to know each
other a bit more now. Again quoting the Wikipedia page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater
intimacy, and a spirit of co-operation emerges.”[3] […] In this stage,
all team members take responsibility and have the ambition to work for
the success of the team’s goals. They start tolerating the whims and
fancies of the other team members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“all team members take responsibility” and “tolerating the whims and
fancies” sounds a bit silly, but sure. Sounds like people getting to
know each other.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><p><em>interlude</em> - on one hand I find it nice that people write
about people dynamics like this. On the other hand it feels wrong;
reducing people to recipies. “This is the recipie for your team”.
Bleh.</p></li>
<li><p>performing :: “stuff works, people focus on achieving goals,
etc”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I found the distinction between forming, storming and
norming a bit intersting.</p>
<ul>
<li>forming: set the right scope, set the right flock of people
together.</li>
<li>storming: people notice that they are all a bit different.</li>
<li>norming: people find ways to work together, accounting for those
differences.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Phew, that was some detour. So which phase are we in? We <em>have
been formed</em> and the wheels aren’t turning with butter smoothness
yet. So storming or norming, which one is it? That’s a little bit hard
to say. I know some people better than others. I think maybe “gain trust
and voice opinions” best describe us. In that case, storming.</p>
<p>So, as a final piece of parting advice for myself - perhaps let the
stormy waters clash for a bit, and pay attention? See where we end
up.</p>
<p>Talk to ya later, Teodor (February 2025)</p>
<p>buuut, wait. “motivation from process or outcomes”. Thank you. We
<em>aren’t</em> quite ready to focus properly on outcomes. We need a bit
of process first! I think that’s good enough for now.</p>
<p>There we go. Until next time.</p>
