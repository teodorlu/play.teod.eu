<h1 class="title">Writing documentation is creative work — not toil</h1>
</header>
<p><a href="./..">..</a></p>
<p><strong>&lt;rant&gt;</strong></p>
<p>“Documentation”.</p>
<p>That killed the conversation quickly, am I right?</p>
<p>It’s that dead thing that’s painful to write. But you gotta do it.
Fun stuff first, mess around.</p>
<p>Then kill any fun you might have had. Scrape up some leftovers, and
put them in words on a page.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve had some of the weirdest conversations in my life when the topic
of documentation comes up. I like writing things down. In fact, I find
<em>great</em> utility in writing things down. My writing extends my
mind.</p>
<p>Without writing things down, I either have to keep lots and lots of
moving pieces in my head, or lower my expectations.</p>
<p>Instead, I choose to cherish my expectations and explore my taste. I
that process, I write things down. My notes are not output. My notes are
my thinking.</p>
<p>When working with others, I sometimes get a feeling that we’re
following a track towards confusion and vagueness. That’s when I want to
start writing things down. To me this makes sense. Written text has
played a central role in every good thing I’ve made. But others might
have a completely different working process. They think I want to start
producing “documentation”. And “documentation” is defined by something
like “extensive written text that’s tedious to write”. Which is the
complete opposite of what I want. I want to improve <em>perception</em>.
I want to enable us to <em>see better</em>, so that we can create
better.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can documentation be good?</p>
<p>I can find the act of writing documentation to be an enjoyable
experience. It’s so close the <em>intent</em> of <a
href="../intention-relation-action/">Intent, Relationships,
Action</a>.</p>
<p>I approach documentation in the same way I approach code — through <a
href="../feedback-interface-implementation/">Feedback loops, interface
design and how stuff works</a>. I write documentation as the interface
between my understanding and your understanding. The feedback loop tests
how well the documentation explains its topic. Can you understand what
you’ve written yourself? Are you happy with what you’ve written? Can the
documentation you wrote successfully explain the topic to someone else?
Do others find your documentation, or repeatedly ask the same question?
And has anyone ever read the whole thing you wrote?</p>
<p>It pains me that we strive to produce great code, but when it comes
to documentation, we’re content to slap some words on a page and never
look back. In one sentence, we preach continuous delivery, continuous
integration, and caring about working code, as the old timers of the
Agile Manifesto would way. In the next, we see a fellow dev struggle
with complete disorientation, and we turn our backs on them. “oh, it’s
just docs.”, we say, and write more code.</p>
<p><strong>why care about documentation?</strong></p>
<p>Because understanding how to structure knowledge properly turns
situations of total confusion into interesting design problems.</p>
<p>Who knows what? Who needs to know what?</p>
<p>To me, that shared understanding <em>exceptionally
important</em>.</p>
<p>I don’t want us to have an okay-ish shared understanding. I want us
to have shared, crisp intent.</p>
<p>Because that’s our mind. That’s how we work. That’s our strategic
process — or lack thereof.</p>
<p><strong>comments</strong></p>
<p>(the article is over - keep on reading or do something else at your
own leisure :))</p>
<p><em>Erik</em> (Teodor paraphrasing): there was this library I
remember using. Its docs were amazing. I’ve read references. Like, when
you have a list of all the functions and docstrings. Lots of detail. But
there was this .NET libary called triangle.net. They just had a list of
examples. The first example was easy. Then each example introduced
gradually more complexity. I liked that one.</p>
