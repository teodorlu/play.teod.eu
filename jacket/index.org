DRAFT

Goal: a tool for working pages here

- I think [[id:3dd2e3a3-ecf6-41b2-b31f-6a09b9940ef4][Electric Clojure]] is a good fit.
  Write some Clojure code that can be shared between CLI and Electric tool, and use that.
  Electric Clojure can potentially also give me a faster interaction loop than I'm getting otherwise.
- First step: just a HTML table of pages, by created time.

#+INCLUDE: "table.html" export html
