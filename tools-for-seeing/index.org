#+TITLE: tools for seeing

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

/A note on something I had to learn about how to work with systems/

*throughput, inventory and operational expense* is a tool for seeing.

*a unit test* is a tool for seeing.

*a REPL* is a tool for seeing.

*immutability* is a tool for seeing.
Without it, a clear image of the system becomes harder to obtain.

/when working with systems, we need to develop tools for seeing alongside building the system to achieve the system's goals/
