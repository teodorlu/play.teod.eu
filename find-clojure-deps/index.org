#+TITLE: Where do you find your Clojure dependencies?

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Where do you find your Clojure dependencies?

Problems we want to address:

1. I need to solve a problem and I don't know which libraries can help me
2. I can't remember the name of some dependency I've used before
3. I want to learn how experienced people work, and see which tools they use.

Rough structure:

1. Present real problems, in a real situation.
2. How can we solve this?
3. Explain the path Nezz takes.
4. Gifs and videos!
5. (should I ask to present on London Clojurians? If so, I need to fill more time!)
6. Call to action
