<p><em>How can we keep learning from each other in a technology
organization?</em></p>
<p>My mind was racing as I was in the middle of the churn. Features,
features, features! Build more! Do more! Look down, focus on what you’re
doing!</p>
<p>But what about the long term? Is what I am staring at right now the
only thing I will get to learn? Sometimes focus is needed. But sometimes
we need to lift our head and look around. What other things are there?
Are those worth learning? A good place to start is <em>who one can learn
from</em>. That requires knowing who’s around, who they are, and what
they know and care about. In good organizations, individuals have a
sense of just that. Let’s define that sense precisely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> has been built. People feel safe around each
other, and want to help. (TODO complete writing <a
href="../dont-assume-trust-build-trust/">Don’t assume trust. Build
trust.</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Shared intent</strong> is established. Individuals have a
shared understanding of what the goal is.</li>
<li><strong>Shared sense of quality</strong> is present between
individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The responsibilty of building trust and establishing shared intent
largely falls on the leaders of the organization. Shared sense of
quality is something i believe in building from the bottom up. Who are
you? What do you care about? What do you find to be <em>good</em>? I
love conversations where I gain a deeper understanding about what
someone <em>really finds to be good</em>. Yesterday, I met someone who
said that “The role of art is to criticise society”. At first, I was
sceptical. Does aesthetics have to be useful? Can we hope to place the
burden of utility on aesthetics? But aesthetics is not art. Good art can
be beautiful. But not all beautiful things are art. I believe that <a
href="../utility-is-contextual/">utility is contextual</a>. And art
exists in a context. It exists in our society.</p>
<p>Through that interaction, we gained a shared sense of quality.</p>
<p>Let’s recap.</p>
<ol>
<li>We build <em>shared sense of quality</em> when either I understand
what you think is good, or you understand what I think is good.</li>
<li>Good organizations are characterized by shared sense of
quality.</li>
<li>The responsibilty of building shared sense of quality is on
everyone, not just managers.</li>
</ol>
<p>So how do we ship shared sense of quality? I’ve claimed that <a
href="../theres-always-a-deliverable/">there’s always a deliverable</a>;
what’s the deliverable for shared sense of quality? One answer is
reflective text. Try answering these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are you up to right now?</li>
<li>Do you find quality in it?</li>
<li>Why? Why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>Did you discover something? Reading the questions, I have to give it
a shot right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am—surprisingly—sitting here writing. I’m enjoying the experience.
I’ve had a breakfast and coffee. City sounds are trickling in from the
window. I’m working from a Mac, which has been a bit of a shift from my
previous Linux usage. I like using the writing toolkit I’ve made for
myself for writing on <a href="../play.teod.eu/">play.teod.eu</a>,
especially my system for linking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if we distributed those three questions to an organization, and
received regular answers? What would that do to an organization over
time? If people actually knew the interests and values of others?</p>
<p>That’s what I’m trying to do with Mikrobloggeriet. So far, the
results have been amazing. Oddmund, Lars and Richard have written 32
microblog entries. I’ve greatly enjoyed reading those. Limiting scope
has been a challenge, as it often is. My intent was originally to limit
the writing exercise to 10 minutes, so that it can be interspersed into
an otherwise busy day. I quickly blew that budget completely when I
wrote <a href="https://mikrobloggeriet.no/o/olorm-7/">my first
entry</a>, but later <a
href="https://mikrobloggeriet.no/o/olorm-32/">managed to ship a text in
15 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>More broadly, I wish we could actually use the Internet for building
shared sense of quality. All of us. Some of us already are. <a
href="../visakan-veerasamy/">Visakan Veerasamy</a> is a great example,
most of his blog posts, and interactions over Twitter is about playing
around with what’s good. I believe you should <a
href="../keep-your-aesthetic-playful/">keep your aesthetic playful</a>,
and Visa is a good example in practice. <a
href="../stuttaford-systems-thinking/">Systems Thinking - Notes and
Resources, by Robert Stuttaford</a> is another good example. It’s an
exploration.</p>
<p>When I started making <a href="../play.teod.eu/">play.teod.eu</a>,
one of my principles was to play with content and medium. I didn’t want
it to be serious. Hence the domain name. That has worked for me. If I
had tried writing a serious blog with serious entries of proper, serious
information, I probably would have quit.</p>
<p>So, does playing around with your aesthetic sound fun? Want to
explore what’s good? Come write with us :)</p>
