Note: there's no "goodness" column.
"Goodness" is hard to compare.
Instead, i strive for a precise, non-monocausal way of organization.

It's possible to be precise about generalities (good philosophy), and it's possible to be precise about specifics (good measurement, good planning).

For example:

|           | *Specific*                                         | *General*                   |
|-----------+----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| *Precise* | Good measurement, solid observation, good planning | Good philosophy             |
| *Vague*   | Stuff that's plain wrong.                          | Getting lost in abstraction |

Or:

|           | *Specific*                | *General*                    |
|-----------+---------------------------+------------------------------|
| *Precise* | Detail                    | Good logic, good mathematics |
| *Vague*   | Stuff that's plain wrong. | Equivocation                 |

Which set of examples would you prefer? Why?
* 2D version -- precision and generality
Easier to draw.
* My friction -- want to move right.
I often accept a small loss of precision to gain generality.
Others are often happy with me when I strive to be specific.
* consider :subjectivity
Here's a table:

| axis          | when 0 %     | when 100 %   |
|---------------+--------------+--------------|
| :generality   | event        | physical law |
| :novelty      | known by all | known by 1   |
| :precision    | dream        | logic        |
| :subjectivity | event        | taste        |
* Consider assigning :generality :novelty :precision :subjectivity to all articles
Then I can query on stuff.

Can either be a 0-1 scale, or :low, :medium, :high

| :low    | ~0.2 |
| :medium | ~0.5 |
| :high   | ~0.8 |

Default values (humble)

| :generality   | :low  |
| :novelty      | :low  |
| :precision    | :low  |
| :subjectivity | :high |

By default, "just saying stuff" does:

- not generalize
- doesn't provide anything new
- is vague
- and subjective.

* Assigning correlation to value allows rich ordering

| :generality   | 0.8 |
| :novelty      | 0.8 |
| :precision    |   1 |
| :subjectivity |   0 |

That means I can actually order by "good stuff" ü§î

$$
good := \textit{correlation_map}^T * \textit{article_things}
$$

Hmm.

* People can bring their own correlation thing
Here are some contrasting views.
Please don't mind me shrugging in the middle.

| specific | Keep it specific | ü§∑ | I like general theories  | general     |
| novel    | Gimme new ideas  | ü§∑ | I read old knowlege      | time tested |
| precise  | Use words right  | ü§∑ | the journey is to dream ‚ù§Ô∏è | poetic      |
| data     | Give me facts.   | ü§∑ | What do you like?        | emotion     |

I can make a nice little UI that works on this.

* Data oriented programming is precise, general and novel
* Christopher Alexander talks about :liveness
See: https://dorian.substack.com/p/at-any-given-moment-in-a-process

What is liveness? What is degree of life?

Definitions:

- *Wholeness* is really about treating everything you do as inseparable from a context.
  Nothing exists in a vacuum.
  Alexander saw building not as creating something new, but as repairing the surrounding environment.
- *Life*, in Alexander‚Äôs formulation, is a similar process to Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs idea of local elimination of entropy.
  That is, objects that were not strictly biologically alive could still be ‚Äúalive‚Äù through a form of symbiosis with
  entities that are biologically alive.
- *Living structure* refers to artifacts that exhibit this kind of life.
  These are structures that attract people (and animals, and plants, etc.) to come and live their lives within and around them, reinforcing and enriching them.
  This is not unlike how an anthill is a living structure, as it is constantly being maintained and expanded.
  Living structure makes you want to take care of it, because it takes care of you.
* Reflection, journal, etc.

1. Seeing how high scores they got was amazing
2. I don't like the "subjectivity" label -- it's not value laden.
   1. Alternative: taste. Is it tasteful?
   2. Alternative: liveness. Does it live, or is it dead?
      1. Tabel scores higher than Deutsch.
