<h1 class="title">On the balance between design and implementation when
we build software</h1>
</header>
<p><a href="..">..</a></p>
<p>X: ‚Äúdesign‚Äù? You mean the work designers do?</p>
<p>T: No. I mean software design. I have a beef with the current usage
of the word ‚Äúdesign‚Äù. We‚Äôre using it vaguely! I used to do design of
steel structures and design of concrete structures. These days I often
engage in software design.</p>
<p>I feel like the agile movement inadvertently dragged in an assumption
that design is bad, and writing code is better. I think ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do
design, write code instead‚Äù is a <em>really bad idea</em>.</p>
<p>X: So ‚Ä¶ Why now?</p>
<p>T: I‚Äôm working with two great people. Having a lot of fun. But I feel
like we struggle a lot finding a balance between design and
implementation. Right now, we talk a lot about implementation details,
but <em>not</em> about system design.</p>
<p>X: Ah, I get it! You‚Äôre talking about architecture! Software
architecture!</p>
<p>T: üòÖ I ‚Ä¶ have a bit of a beef with that word too.</p>
<p>X: why?</p>
<p>T: We software developers took the word ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù from civil
engineering projects, and I fear that we took the wrong word. In
software, we want to talk about the <em>core</em> of our system.
Architects <em>can do</em> the start of the work, if what you care about
is <em>floor plan utilization</em>, and the civil engineering is
trivial. Architects <em>do not</em> build bridges. Architects <em>do
not</em> build dams. Architects <em>do not</em> build industrial plants.
In those cases, the civil engineers (or construction engineers) hold the
‚Äúcore‚Äù.</p>
<p>X: so ‚Ä¶ which word, then, if architecture is bad?</p>
<p>T: I think the word is ‚Äúdesign‚Äù. And for systems, ‚Äúsystem
design‚Äù!</p>
<p>X: okay. Man, when you <em>insist</em> on redefining words before you
even start speaking, it sometimes rubs me the wrong way. It‚Äôs like
everything I say is wrong, right?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, I know. Sorry about that. I don‚Äôt know of a better way ‚Äî
other than leaning completely into the arts, presenting ideas as
theater, dialogue or as novels. Steal from <a
href="../eliyahu-goldratt/">Eliyahu Goldratt</a>‚Äôs way of presenting
things, perhaps.</p>
<p>X: yeah, yeah. I don‚Äôt always have time for that, you know?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, there‚Äôs <em>so much f-in stuff</em>. I feel like we could
make due with <em>less stuff</em>. But that requires some thinking.</p>
<p>X: So ‚Ä¶ What was that balance you mentioned? A balance between design
and implementation?</p>
<p>T: Right. Thanks. That was where we started.</p>
<p>We spend <em>so much time</em> on implementation and <em>so little
time on design</em>. And we‚Äôre calling it ‚Äúagile‚Äù. ‚Äúagile‚Äù as an excuse
for coding up things when we don‚Äôt have any idea why we have to do the
things we do. If we slow down, we might get pressure to speed up. It‚Äôs
lean to do less stuff. But rather than cut the problems we don‚Äôt care
about, we solve the problems we care about badly!</p>
<p>This is where design comes in. We should <em>know what our goal
is</em>. I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm at a point where I have no interest in writing code
unless the goal is clear.</p>
<p>X: what about teamwork? Everyone needs to know what do do, right?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, that‚Äôs the hard part. It‚Äôs harder to solve real problems
than write code. And it‚Äôs <em>even harder</em> when you‚Äôre a team. So
much shared context is needed.</p>
<p>X: So, what do we do?</p>
<p>T: I‚Äôm discovering this myself as I go along. I‚Äôve had success with
two activities.</p>
<p>One activity is pair programming. This one is hard. Knowing when to
focus on design and when to focus on implementation is hard. I think
great pairing is something you have to re-learn every time you pair with
someone new. Without trust, this will simply fail. And that trust needs
to go both ways. I need to trust you, and you need to trust me.</p>
<p>Another activity is to use a decision matrix to compare approaches to
solve a problem. A decision matrix lets you do clean software design
work without getting stuck in all the details.</p>
<p>X: How should I learn pair programming?</p>
<p>T: Ideally, you get to pair with someone who is good at pair
programming. I had the chance to pair with <a
href="../lars-barlindhaug/">Lars Barlindhaug</a> in 2019 and <a
href="../oddmund-stromme/">Oddmund Str√∏mme</a> in 2020. From Lars, I
learned that it‚Äôs better to organize your code into modules where each
module solves a problem you care about. From Oddmund, I learned that I
could work in smaller increments.</p>
<p>If you do not have someone you can learn pairing from on your team,
watch <a href="../magnar-sveen/">Magnar Sveen</a> and <a
href="../christian-johansen/">Christian Johansen</a> pair from their
YouTube screencasts: <a
href="https://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/">https://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/</a></p>
<p>X: And ‚Ä¶ those decision matrices?</p>
<p>T: Watch <a href="../rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a> explain decision
matrices in <a href="../design-in-practice/">Design in Practice</a>.
Then try it out with your team!</p>
