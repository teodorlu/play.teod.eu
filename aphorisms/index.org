#+title: Aphorisms

[[./..][..]]

1 - Fewer moving pieces is better.

2 - (stronger) - More than minimum number of moving pieces is bad.

3 - Chase intent. Ask why.

4 - Late binding is awesome.

5 - Never link to content without enriching the intent of linking with context.

6 - Consider modeling /all possible states/ as one data structure. That can reduce edge cases.
