Initial call to action to start building our knowledge archipelago.
* 2022-07-01
Lobbied heavily for people to take part
* 2022-07-02
** I want:
1. Separate islands of content
2. A collaboratively worked-on index into the system
   1. Ask Ole Jacob to help?
   2. Can it be just frontend?
      1. Redeploy to register new sites
      2. cache index in indexeddb/ localstorage
      3. refresh index on each new page load
   3. Consider having it work with Iterbart
** Possible process name: bottom-up knowledge synthesis
Me likey.
** People to ask to collaborate
Richard? Nils? Henrik? Andreas?

Well, everyone, really. People bring stuff to the table.
