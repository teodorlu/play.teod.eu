DRAFT

* about play.teod.eu

Name. Should this be "meta"?

No.
"Meta" is never narrow.
Go for a single global layer, please.

* I need to "contract" / "narrow" before publishing

The stuff that's published on my site right now is a real mess.
Mess how?
In many ways.
But the big one: the ideas are intertwined.
There's coupling.
I could remove that coupling.
Or at least attempt to remove that coupling.

* Date tagging

I want metadata for :changed and :created.
First because I want to filter / sort.
Then perhaps later because that metadata is nice to have.
