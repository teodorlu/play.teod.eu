#+TITLE: Git commit messages should be good, right?

[[./..][..]]

I sometimes write bad commit messages.
Here on play.teod.eu, I write /particularly/ bad commit messages.
See for yourself:

#+begin_src
$ (cd ~/dev/teodorlu/play.teod.eu && git log --oneline | head -n 20)

Why?

In certain contexts, I value a near-zero threshold for changing things more than I value the ledger of changes.
This is absolutely context dependent.
Dependent on what?

| Many people working on project   | One person messing around will cause confusion              | Don't mess around in the commit log                          |
| Codebase is changed frequently   | You remember what's there                                   | Don't fear, change, try. If bad, revert                      |
| Codebase is changed infrequently | Effort to get into context outweighs effort to apply change | Prioritize good CI, know the impact of what you're changing. |
