#+TITLE: There's always a deliverable

[[file:..][..]]

In tactical work, there's a deliverable.
In strategic work, there's a deliverable.

Just because realized end user value is further away, that doesn't mean we can't deliver something specific.
We just have to define our impact in terms of an intermediate goal, not the end state.

Strong values make intermediate goals easier.
With strong values, simply staying true to your values is a goal in itself.

First, the default --- write journal. Something like [[id:bd776ab0-d687-4f16-b66d-d03c86de2a2e][My public journal]].
