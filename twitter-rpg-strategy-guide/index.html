<p>I decided I wanted to take this text seriously, so I’m transcribing
and editing for sane HTML formatting. What follows is Visa’s words, not
mine.</p>
<p>Visa, if you read this and want me to take this down, please let me

<h2 id="twitter-rpg-strategy-guide.txt-1">twitter rpg strategy
guide.txt</h2>
<p>Twitter is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, primarily
text-based with limited multimedia support. It combines elements of
role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive
fiction and online chat.</p>
<p>Players can read, view and contribute descriptions of objects, other
players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual
world, as well as the “real” world. Players typically interact with each
other by utilizing strings that resemble natural language.</p>
<p>While traditional MUDs typically implement RPGs set in distinct
fantasy worlds populated by fictional races and monsters, with players
choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers, Twitter
allows every player to project their own fantasy and define their own
game.</p>
<p>The flexible nature of Twitter makes it difficult for any singulra
definition of “the game” to become canonical. Conflict between players
with different interpretations of Twitter is a key feature of Twitter
itself. Indeed, one of the most popular games is “hey, fuck that
guy”.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, few players put much thought into precisely defining
the game that they are playing. Most players “pick it up” organically as
they go along, inheriting the unwritten rules and norms of their peers
via imitation and (limited) experimentation.</p>
<p>Twitter is also searchable, and allows tweets to be “threaded” in
chains.</p>
<p>This allows skilled players to build incredibly complex tapestries of
hypertext, consisting of thousands of tweets.</p>
<p>Why would such prolific players choose Twitter as a medium, rather
than “websites” or “books”, which appear to be better suited to large
volumes of content?</p>
<p>Because Twitter allows any player to interact with any other player’s
tweets.</p>
<p>Most casual players do not appear to have caught on to the true
potential utility of Twitter, or perhaps they are indifferent to it.</p>
<p>A web of tweets is a living entity that allows players to meet,
interact and engage with 1000s of others <em>at the level of individual
thoughts</em>.</p>
<p>Properly constructed, a web of tweets allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>witness how other players discover your tweets, via their
patterns of likes, retweets and quote tweets</p></li>
<li><p>connect each fragmented thought and experience into the part of a
greater whole</p></li>
<li><p>recognise and embellish patterns in your own play.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have not even begun talking about relationships. People can build
relationships with other players over time and shared interactions.
Through cooperation, multiple players can share and merge webs with one
another, helping each other find and share the desired information.</p>
<p>Players observed to be “good” and “fun” have even been known to
invite each other to meetups, offer each other jobs, become “friends”
outside of Twitter. Twitter is a game with extremely real stakes and
consequences, both good and bad.</p>
<p>You are not limited to a single identity or account on Twitter. A
single individual can play as many different players simultaneously. You
can invent entirely different identities and have radically different
experiences with each.</p>
<p>Any player can significantly improve their experience of Twitter by
examining their own usage and evaluating it against their own desires
and goals.</p>
<p>At any moment, any player can completely change their experience of
Twitter by deciding to play it differently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you following? Why?</li>
<li>What are you tweeting? Why?</li>
<li>What exeriences would you like to have? Why?</li>
<li>Who would you like to play with? How? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p>With a little introspection, Twitter can be a tool for self-inquiry,
making friends, testing ideas, messing around, finding information,
practicing speech, and pretty much anything you like.</p>
<p>It’s also, like everything else, just a game.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
<p>[16 days of silence]</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m still not done geeking out about how great Twitter is.
Any tweet from any thread can be reused on any other thread,,, do you
guys realise how wild that is??? It allows you to create your own
cinematic universe.</p>
