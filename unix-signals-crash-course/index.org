#+title: Unix signals: a crash course

[[./..][..]]

* Goals

1. Learn to send and handle common Unix signals
2. Be able to handle sigterm and sigint while cleaning up temporary processes

* List of Unix signals

We're going to focus on four signals:

| Signal | Name    | Effect                               |
|--------+---------+--------------------------------------|
|      1 | SIGHUP  | Reload configuration (hack!)         |
|      2 | SIGINT  | Terminate process, allow for cleanup |
|      9 | SIGKILL | Terminate immediately - no cleanup   |
|     15 | SIGTERM | Terminate process, allow for cleanup |

The manual (=man signal=) contains a longer list.

* How to list running processes

| =ps=     | Show some running processes    |
| =ps aux= | Show lots of running processes |

=ps= and =ps aux= pair great with fuzzy-finders --- such as grep and fzf. To find
a running process interactively, try =ps | fzf= or =ps aux | fzf=.

But what can we do with a process? Well, we can kill it. And ... I must
reluctantly admit I don't know anything else we can do with it.

* How do I kill a process?

First, we need something to kill. ☠️

#+begin_src bash
# Leave this running in a terminal
sleep 9999
#+end_src

To kill a process, we can use =kill= or =pkill=. Kill requires a process ID
(number).

#+begin_src bash :exports both
# Find the process ID with `ps` and `grep`
ps | grep sleep
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 33312 ttys003    0:00.00 sleep 9999999

33312 is our ID.

#+begin_src bash
# Now kill it!
kill 33312
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

With =pkill=, we can give a /pattern/ - or just the full process name.

#+begin_src bash
# Start a long running process in another terminal
sleep 9999999
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
# Then kill it off.
pkill sleep
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* How do I kill a process with a specific signal?

=kill= and =pkill= accept a first argument as signal code. To kill with SIGINT,
use =kill -2 PID= or =pkill -2 PNAME=.

#+begin_src bash
# Again ..
sleep 9999999
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
# Now, try SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGKILL or SIGKILL and see what happens.
pkill -1 sleep
pkill -2 sleep
pkill -9 sleep
pkill -15 sleep
# Does the sleep process stop? Does it print anything?
#+end_src
