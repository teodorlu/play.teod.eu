#+TITLE: prompts for learning

[[file:..][..]]

Sometimes we need a nudge to keep on learning, and not get stuck.
I'll share a specific approach to make that happen.

*Motivation*.
Why do we want to do this?
To "learn" is one reason.
But there are three deeper reasons:

1. To build a trust-based mentoring relationship.
2. To exercise [[id:efbb9f44-9a8e-436e-bf68-ff19d5bd990c][growth mindset]].
3. To exercise [[id:5fd923f9-dc43-4a82-ac59-8785e98bc901][coachability]].

Learning is good.
But permanently boosting your learning speed is even better!
Let's make that happen.

*Process*.
Follow these steps:

1. Find someone you trust
2. Write three or six answers, your choice
3. Share the answers with the person you trust

Then make sure you do this /again/.
Try starting with once a month.
That's it!

*Prompts to build awareness*:

- What's one example of something you think is hard?
- What do you want to learn?
- What's something you're good at?

*Hard mode prompts: build awareness /and/ execute*:

- What's one example of something you think is hard?
  - Can you give one example of a person around you that finds this less hard?
- What do you want to learn?
  - Can you give one example of an activity that can help you learn that thing?
- What's something you're good at?
  - Do you see anyone around you that needs your help with that?

*Now, do it!*
What's hard?
What you do want to learn?
What are you good at?
Write those down and send to a friend!
