#+title: Precise, general, novel

[[./..][..]]

Three axes:

| vague      | precise |
| specific   | general |
| well-known | novel   |

Forms a 3D space.

Pysics: precise, general, well-known.

My engineering experience: precise, quite specific, novel.

Web3 wild speculation: vague, general, novel.

Idea --- always better to move to the right.
But hard.

* From a long long time ago
Copied over from: https://subcons.teod.eu/specific-precise/

It's possible to be precise about generalities (good philosophy), and it's possible to be precise about specifics (good measurement, good planning).

For example:

|           | *Specific*                                         | *General*                   |
|-----------+----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| *Precise* | Good measurement, solid observation, good planning | Good philosophy             |
| *Vague*   | Stuff that's plain wrong.                          | Getting lost in abstraction |

Or:

|           | *Specific*                | *General*                    |
|-----------+---------------------------+------------------------------|
| *Precise* | Detail                    | Good logic, good mathematics |
| *Vague*   | Stuff that's plain wrong. | Equivocation                 |

Which set of examples would you prefer? Why?
* 2D version -- precision and generality
Easier to draw.
* My friction -- want to move right.
I often accept a small loss of precision to gain generality.
Others are often happy with me when I strive to be specific.
* consider :subjectivity
Here's a table:

| axis          | as 0         | as 1         |
| :generality   | event        | physical law |
| :novelty      | known by all | known by 1   |
| :precision    | dream        | logic        |
| :subjectivity | event        | taste        |
* Consider assigning :generality :novelty :precision :subjectivity to all articles
Then I can query on stuff.

Can either be a 0-1 scale, or :low, :medium, :high

| :low    | ~0.2 |
| :medium | ~0.5 |
| :high   | ~0.8 |

Default values (humble)

| :generality   | :low  |
| :novelty      | :low  |
| :precision    | :low  |
| :subjectivity | :high |

By default, "just saying stuff" does:

- not generalize
- doesn't provide anything new
- is vague
- and subjective.

* Assigning correlation to value allows rich ordering

| :generality   | 0.8 |
| :novelty      | 0.8 |
| :precision    |   1 |
| :subjectivity |   0 |

That means I can actually order by "good stuff" ü§î

good := correlation_map^T * article_things

Hmm.
* People can bring their own correlation thing
| Keep it specific, please | ü§∑ | I like general theories    |
| Show me new ideas        | ü§∑ | Show me old knowlege       |
| BE PRECISE!              | ü§∑ | the journey is to dream ‚ù§Ô∏è |
| Give me facts.           | ü§∑ | What do you like?          |

I can make a nice little UI that works on this.
