#+begin_quote
Opportunity is the space between your competitors' assumptions
#+end_quote

😁

#+begin_quote
Intuition is the antonym of reason
#+end_quote

Agreed.
But I wonder whether those terms are meant to be value-laden.
Is one better than the other?

I would say quite strongly /no/.

#+begin_quote
Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is just an opinion
#+end_quote

Oooooh.
So theory /needs/ to be composed out of numbers?

(Interlude - I feel myself /actively trying/ to find holes right now.
Not out of malice, but out of curiosity and ambition)

I think [[id:369abfa2-8b8c-4540-958f-d0fce79f132b][David Deutsch]] would disagree.

Though if we substitute "numbers" for "objectively falsifiable theory and observation", I'm inclined to agree.

#+begin_quote
Being understood is too big an ask because it requires controlling the other person's perspective. Try instead to communicate
#+end_quote

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

#+begin_quote
Communication usually fails, except by accident
#+end_quote

🤔
I think this one might be right.

Related:

1. Trust must be built, it cannot be assumed.
2. Communication requries some degree of trust.
3. Trust requires an /initial charitable action/.
   Someone must allow it to grow.

#+begin_quote
You Can't Tell People Anything (you have to show them)
#+end_quote

:)
I think https://electric-examples-app.fly.dev/ is a GREAT example of this principle applied.

#+begin_quote
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
#+end_quote

Agreed.
Your habits set your baseline.
Habits ~ system.

Also, this is psychologically safe, and protects against burnout.
If you're feeling bad, just /don't destroy your systems+habits today/.
That's enough.
You can be exceptional later.

#+begin_quote
The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension — Nat Friedman
#+end_quote

I have no idea what Dustin/Nat mean by "uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension".
Uncorrelated -> cosine similarity is 0, so that each "axis" of excellence is independent?
Not sure.

Though I'd guess that it's about

1. Baseline novelty -- what's actually new here?
2. Orthogonality -- how can we decompose that novelty into simple parts?

But then, why "in some dimension"?

#+begin_quote
Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. — Muhammad Ali
#+end_quote

😄

Climb that mountain!
Prove them wrong!

#+begin_quote
If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual. Human potential manifests in individuals. — Dan Ingalls
#+end_quote

Hmm.
I think I agree with this one.
Yet, I don't think I completely understand it.
Nor have I internalized it.

#+begin_quote
Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them
#+end_quote

Yes!
This is a [[id:407a392f-53fa-4bd5-b38c-8491d6e4ed37][Karl Popper]] quote, right?

13:59 edit: no! It's Alfred North Whitehead.
