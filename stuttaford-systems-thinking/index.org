#+TITLE: Systems Thinking - Notes and Resources, by Robert Stuttaford

[[file:..][..]]

https://rostnl.notion.site/

Why is this interesting?

1. I'm interested in "sociotechnological systems" -- especially commentary by folks open to discussing, not just wanting people to read their book
2. The use of "Notion as knowledge base" is interesting
   1. Note - he also has a website.
      So I assume Notion is better for "getting things done" for him than just using the website for everything.
      And I assume he keeps the website so that he can control the layout completely.

A system is not the sum of its parts, but rather the **product of its interactions**.

Yup!
Relations, relations.

I enjoy this presentation.

On WIP:

#+begin_quote
Categories of waste

- Partially done work
#+end_quote

Reminds me of my own attitude towards work in progress.
It's bad.
From my [[id:93ea907e-9dcb-4c6b-af7d-d9bc22c34d57][Aphorisms]]:

#+begin_quote
10 - When in doubt, do that which builds trust.

11 - When still in doubt, do that which reifies and distributes intent.

12 - When /still/ in doubt, reduce WIP.

13 - When /STILL/ in doubt, improve your specific & general feedback loops.
