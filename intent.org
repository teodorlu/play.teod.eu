** Feeling the need for opt-in structure
Right now, I have multilpe separate files & folders - each separate, living on
its own.

I'm feeling that the need for playground.edn has come.

Why?

Specifically - it could deliver a title for the main index. And I could separate
drafts and incomplete work from other stuff.
** If I was going to publish a Clerk document, how would I do it?
Ideas:

1. make all of this a clojure project
2. create a clojure project for clerk notebooks in a subdirectory - then copy
   the files out on demand
   1. Could perhaps have placeholder =playground.edn= files that point to the source
   2. Or =notebooks/= could mirror "/" - so that =notebooks/pendulum.clj= is
      compiled into =pendulum/index.html=.
