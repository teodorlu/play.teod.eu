Do you want /even more/ Rich Hickey content?
Talles L has [[https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub][collected links to almost Rich Hickey has presented]].
Matthias Nehlsen has also [[https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts][collected and transcribed Clojure-related talks]].
Note: those two URLs contain /a lot/ of content, I'm estimating more than 100 hours of video.
