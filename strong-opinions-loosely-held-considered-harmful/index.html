<p><em>Instead, please try “hold narrow opinions, ask good
questions”.</em></p>
<h2 id="73c043">Part 1 – a taxonomy of knowledge.</h2>
<p>“Strong opinions” is an excuse for imprecise, sloppy thinking. Sloppy
thinking is bad. Don’t do it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? I think so. First, I propose a taxonomy of
knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge
<ul>
<li>Fact
<ul>
<li>Observation</li>
<li>Implication</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Judgement
<ul>
<li>Aphorism</li>
<li>Contextual utility</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>An observation is a record in time.</em> Observations are facts.
“On 2022-12-17, I saw a user struggle to understand how to navigate an
app I made” is an observation.</p>
<p><em>An implication connects cause and relation".</em> Implications
are facts. “If we separate between mutable code and immutable code, we
derive a clean caching strategy for the immutable code” is an
implications. Another example is “When the user gets a login error,
there’s a fault in the system John is making”.</p>
<p>Facts can be invalidated. We can misremember events, or use sloppy
logic. Facts are true or false, not good or bad.</p>
<p>In contrast, judgment is subjective. You can ask people for
information, for facts. You can also ask people for help judging
something. Here are three examples:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>observation</td>
<td>Mark practically knows Go’s standard library by heart, we was able
to point me to <a
href="https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Split">strings.Split()</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>implication</td>
<td>Last Tuesday, Ben helped me figure out why code crashed when I was
stuck.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>judgment</td>
<td>I asked Ann how I should approach working with a customer, and she
helped me understand their point of view.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I split judgment into aphorism and contextual utility.</p>
<p><em>An aphorism is a deeply held belief</em>. It’s part of your
theory of the world. “Do: treat people with respect” is an aphorism.
Your aphorisms are shaped by your experience. Treating the people you
meet with respect is good for long term relationships, but it might
cause you harm in low trust environments. It would be nice to just be
perfect. I’m not. You’re probably not either. We humans are. We can’t
rewrite our past, we must live with it. I believe we should accept that
we hold deep beliefs which cannot be changed on a whim.</p>
<p><em>Contextual utility is when you recognize a good thing to do in a
situation.</em> You’re able to recognize and match some situation to
potential actions, and pick one that makes sense. You ask a good follow
up question because you recognize the situation of your conversation
partner, have a hunch of where to move the conversation, and are able to
open up something that was previously fuzzy and unknown.</p>
<center>
!
</center>

<p>Phew. That was a lot. We’ve got a bit further to go, please bear with
me. I promise that there’s a specific call to action at the end!</p>
<center>
😺
</center>

<h2 id="71e9ee">Part 2 – so what?</h2>
<p>By talking more precisely about knowledge, we can build better stuff
together. So, where does “better” fit into this hierarchy of knowledge?
Where’s the quality? That’s a great question, and I don’t have a precise
answer. I believe quality is both objective and subjective. It doesn’t
fit neatly into either of the four categories. Rather, it ties fact and
judgment together.</p>
<p>So, what should we do?</p>
<p>I started out claiming that “Strong opinions loosely held” is an
excuse for sloppy thinking. A strong opinion stands on its own, as a
whole. It is in part observation, in part implication, in part aphorism
and in part contextual utility. A big, monolithic opinion is hard to
criticize precisely. You either agree with it, or you don’t. When you’re
choosing to hold strong opinions, you put the burden of total analysis
on your conversational partner. I think that’s a bad thing to do. And
you can choose to <em>not do it</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, hold and present <em>narrow opinions</em>. Avoid depending
on your aphorisms when possible. When expressing contextual utility,
make the context explicit. Explain the situation in which you’re
suggesting your cause of action. Complex problems tend to require
observations, implications and contextual utility. Don’t lump these
together. Split them. By sharing your observations, others can trust
your perception, or present conflicting evidence. Your implications can
help others learn how you reason. When you’ve split up and recomposed
your problem, end by asking questions to shape the conversation. Help
people help you by sharing where you’re uncertain. Are you missing
information? Is there a part of your suggested course of action you’re
not confident about? How can other people help you? Ask about that. Then
people can understand where you’re coming from, and how they can help
you.</p>
<p><em>How about you? You’re just perfectly doing this all the
time?</em> Not at all. This is an ideal! Precise thinking requires more
effort.</p>
<h2 id="7f5c12">Part 3 – write shit down.</h2>
<p>If you don’t make your thinking explicit, you won’t be able to look
at your thinking from the outside. Explicit thinking is exactly what you
get when you write down what you think. You disconnect from the react to
what’s happening right now loop. You can revisit your thoughts at a
later point in time, and see if you still believe what you wrote.</p>
<p>Let compassion for others motivate you when you write. You should
care about your target audience. At least if you’re going to solve hard
problems together. Take your time to disassemble your ball of ideas
before you attempt to shove it into another person’s head. Or be precise
in what you’re asking for. “You should do as I say” is a very different
thing to ask for than “Can you help me disentangle this problem I can’t
get my head around?”</p>
<p>Writing is caring.</p>

<p>I don’t want to discourage people from trying or learning. Yet, I
want to be clear. Not quite sure how to balance that. Comments &amp;
reactions welcome, curious if people find this encouraging, insulting or
somwehere in between.</p>

<h4 id="db23f">The jump from “sloppy thinking” to “a taxonomy of
knowledge” is sudden, surprising</h4>
<p>I start out like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Strong opinions” is an excuse for imprecise, sloppy thinking. Sloppy
thinking is bad. Don’t do it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? I think so. First, I propose a taxonomy of

<li>Aphorism</li>
<li>Contextual utility</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The jump from sloppy thinking to a taxonomy of knowledge strikes me
as sudden and surprising. Suggestions for improvement are much welcome.
I especially dislike the “Is there an alternative? I think so. First, I
propose a taxonomy of knowledge” part.</p>
