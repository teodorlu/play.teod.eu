;; I don't need no makefile
;; I don't need no task
;; I just need a REPL eval

;; What brought us here?
;; I stumbled over https://aartaka.me/pidgin.html by Artyom Bologov yesterday.
;; I liked what I saw so much that I had to send an email!
;; Later the same evening, I got a super-pleasant reply.
;; He had read my poetry 😂
;; And asked for an RSS feeed.

;; I *have* been RSS curious, so why not.

;; But I have a problem.
;; I have piles of drafts live on the web, that's not meant for anybody.
;; Additionally, I mix Enlish and Norwegian.
;; My solution: tailored RSS feeds.
;; I'll start with english-ready-for-comments.rss
