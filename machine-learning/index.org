https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning

This document is a sort of reference for me about machine learning topics.

- [[id:385744ba-95d4-45ac-b10e-6a8392e3ba80][gradient descent]] is a way to train a [[id:14d7645f-70e8-4505-9c59-c76c6aea7ff1][neural network]].
  gradient descent requires that the model is expressed in a way that one can "take the gradient" of the model.
- Here's a nice guide to machine learning from the perspective of a Clojure programmer:
  https://matthewdowney.github.io/clojure-neural-networks-from-scratch-mnist.html
- [[http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html][Neural networks from scratch with Numpy]].
  I /started/ following this guide, but never made it to the finish line.
- I think [[id:4ba42678-1667-426d-a07f-dfe96ab46bd2][Jack Rusher]] wrote a tiny neural network-like thing in 10 lines of plain Clojure, but I can't find it.
