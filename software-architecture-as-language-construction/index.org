#+title: Software architecture as langauge construction

[[./..][..]]

#+begin_verse
Idea

Language construction as the major metaphor for software architecture

We either

    construct language

or

    apply language to solve business problems.

Principles for language construction

    minimal number of moving pieces

    each sentence reads on its own

    components have no more dependencies than they actually need

Principles for applying language to solve business problems

    straightforward is best - avoid indirection

    solving business problems when the right modules / words / namespaces are provided should be trivial
