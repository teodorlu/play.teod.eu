#+title: rdf-intro

Intent: introduce RDF for knowledge modeling.

1. Show wikidata
   1. Show how to query with wikidata
2. Show that RDF composes EASILY - in contrast to SQL
3. Consider applying it to play.teod.eu / garden.iterate.no / archipelago.iterate.no
4. Should I show RDF or datascript?
   1. I know datascript, so perhaps just use that.
