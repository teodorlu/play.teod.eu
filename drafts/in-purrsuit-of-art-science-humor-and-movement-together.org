find your purrsuit.
find a joyful, intentful take on your life.

science is great explanations.
reduce clutter.
reduce noise.
spread knowledge.
it's good, i promise!

art is experience, shared.
beauty gives joy.
don't make it too good, too wise,
  if you do, you will not finish, not publish.
    publish for more joy.
learn to respect your taste
  then cherish it, take it seriously
  then watch it evolve

don't take everything too seriously
it's no fun that way
what's more fun?
  make fun of your ego.
  toss it around.
  your hubris, your pride.
  let yourself have hubris, have pride.
    then consider how silly it all is.

don't go all the way alone
movement alone is required
  to some extent
but experience is richer together.
  find someone to move with.
  move in formation.
  or move in chaotic joy.
