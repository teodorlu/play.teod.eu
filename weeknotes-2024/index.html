<p>After <em>yet another batch of structured thinking I fail to follow
up</em>, I decide to try again with a different format, a different
trigger and a different scope.</p>
<p>I found the concept through <a href="../patrick-dubroy/">Patrick
Dubroy</a>’s weeknotes: <a
href="https://github.com/pdubroy/weeknotes/blob/main/notes/2024-11.md">https://github.com/pdubroy/weeknotes/blob/main/notes/2024-11.md</a></p>
<h3 id="why-weeknotes">Why weeknotes</h3>
<p>Weeknotes seem to hit a sweet spot. Once a week, I can do that. I can
even schedule time in my calendar!</p>
<h3 id="on-the-importance-of-learning-from-excellent-people">On the
importance of learning from excellent people</h3>
<p>The only reason whatsoever I’m doing this is because I’ve rigged my
Twitter account to follow a few highly competent people in detail. One
of those people I (subjectively) consider to be highly competent
(without ever having met the person) is <a
href="../patrick-dubroy/">Patrick Dubroy</a>. I caught a tweet in which
Patrick announced that he’d be writing weeknotes, and asked his Twitter
audience whether they would find it useful. I found it <em>very
interesting</em>. Utility will have to wait.</p>
<h3
id="the-best-way-to-find-excellent-people-is-through-trust-networks.">The
best way to find excellent people is through trust networks.</h3>
<p>Step 1: pick someone who you respect and believe you have something
to learn from.</p>
<p>Step 2: observe what they do, read what they write, answer when they
ask questions. Try to help them do things they care about.</p>
<p>Step 3 (the recursive step): explore <em>who they trust</em>. But do
this <em>slowly</em>. The recursive step will open you to get <em>more
content</em>, which is a double edged blade. If they are great and
you’ve read all they have written, great! This is exactly what you need.
If they are actually mediocre, stop. Full stop!</p>
<p>I started thinking about the importance of exploring networks of
trust about a year ago, when I made the frist version of this site (<a
href="../play.teod.eu/">play.teod.eu</a>). That lead me to make first
class support for remote references. Patricks’s page here on my site is
a remote reference. Technically, there’s a metadata file with</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">:form</span> <span class="at">:remote-reference</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>in it, found here: <a
href="https://github.com/teodorlu/play.teod.eu/blob/afc06c6954ee2782057b3bf6b2676a766aeb7d8a/patrick-dubroy/play.edn#L3">https://github.com/teodorlu/play.teod.eu/blob/afc06c6954ee2782057b3bf6b2676a766aeb7d8a/patrick-dubroy/play.edn#L3</a></p>
<p>but that’s not too important.</p>
<p>One of my main lessons from speaking at <a
href="../babashka-conf/">babashka-conf</a> (my talk was <a
href="../build-your-own-little-memex-with-babasha/">Build Your Own
Little Memex with Babashka</a>) was the importance of referring to
sources. And not in a literal “how to write papers” sense, in the
hypertext sense. With hypertext, we can refer effortlessly to sources at
any point in time. And that is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>By the way, I found Patrick by reading <a href="../jack-rusher/">Jack
Rusher</a>’s tweets. I interacted with Jack first on <a
href="../clojureverse/">Clojureverse</a>. I engaged with the Clojure
community on Clojureverse after realizing that the team I currently
worked on didn’t care too much about programming, and wanted to learn
more. I found Clojure kind of randomly by watching a Youtube video about
some guy doing REPL-connected Clojure programming with Emacs. And I
found Clojure sort of by accident after finding Haskell in 2014 (I did a
148 slide presentation about Haskell in Norwegian in 2014, <a
href="../haskell-hardt-og-godt/">Haskell: hardt og godt</a>, in English
something like “Learn Haskell the good, hard way”). And I don’t remember
how I stumbled upon Haskell, other than that I thought it was absolutely
amazing, and embarassing that we had spent so much time at <a
href="../ntnu/">NTNU</a> learning Java.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>I encourage you to look around for the people around you that you’d
like to learn something from, engage with them (take what they say
seriously, ask questions if you don’t think it makes sense, perhaps they
will respond), then dig deeper into the rabbit hole when you’ve got
energy.</p>
<h3
id="on-the-importance-of-slowing-down-and-sharing-knowledge-in-software-teams">On
the importance of slowing down and sharing knowledge in software
teams</h3>
<p>On my current team, we have lots of code, and limited shared
understanding of that code.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that the right thing to do is to slow down and build
shared understanding.</p>
<p>Since joining the team, I’ve spent less than 5 % of my own time
writing code. I do like writing code, so I’d like to increase that
fraction over time. But I hate writing code that isn’t needed, or code
that solves the wrong problem.</p>
<p>So, let’s slow down! First, we build a solid shared understanding.
Then, later on, we’ll use that shared understanding as a foundation to
create &amp; capture value.</p>
<h3 id="kent-beck-knows-his-shit-but-cares-about-everything">Kent Beck
knows his shit, but cares about everything</h3>
<p>I had the fortune to chat briefly with <a href="../kent-beck/">Kent
Beck</a> when he visited Oslo in 2023. He gave a talk about the
importance of feeling safe to people working in <a
href="../iterate-as/">Iterate AS</a>. I felt like that was a bad topic /
audience match. Iterate is so awesome at creating a safe environment for
people that I feel like we struggle with actually expecting people to do
things. Anyway.</p>
<p>Kent Beck ran amazing software teams in the 90s, and wrote <a
href="../extreme-programming-book/">Extreme Programming (book)</a> about
the principles. The most important principle from that book that I had
not taken with sufficient seriousness before 2023 was pair programming,
and its generalization ensemble programming. Pairing is a ridiculously
effective tool to build shared intent. (which is one of the pillars in
my “product howto philosopy”, <a href="../tki-veiledning/">Tillit,
kvalitet og intensjon i praksis: en håndbok for produkt- og
programvareutvikling</a> (Norwegian)).</p>
<p>Kent Beck knew this 30 years ago, I learned it just yet. And it’s …
<em>really really weird</em> to fully lean into the importance of shared
intent. It’s <a href="../rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a>’s ideas from <a
href="../design-in-practice/">Design in Practice</a> taken to to level
9000. To make some ultra-clear directives:</p>
<ol>
<li>NEVER start writing code unless you know what problem you want to
solve.</li>
<li>NEVER start solving you problem unless you have at least two
different approaches.</li>
<li>ALWAYS share the problem and share your options before moving
on.</li>
</ol>
<p>These directives are divisive, and almost every team I’ve ever worked
on break them at every option.</p>
<p>Some people that I <em>don’t</em> think are breaking those rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a> (kinda obvious? <a
href="../hammock-driven-development/">Hammock Driven Development</a> and
<a href="../design-in-practice/">Design in Practice</a> talk about this
directly)</li>
<li><a href="../stuart-halloway/">Stuart Halloway</a>, see <a
href="../debugging-with-the-scientific-method/">Debugging with the
Scientific Method</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../martin-kavalar/">Martin Kavalar</a> and <a
href="../jack-rusher/">Jack Rusher</a>: making <a
href="../clerk/">Clerk</a> so that we can explore options better</li>
<li><a href="../christian-johansen/">Christian Johansen</a> and <a
href="../magnar-sveen/">Magnar Sveen</a>: They’ve been pairing
effectively for <em>years</em>.</li>
<li><a href="../evan-czaplicki/">Evan Czaplicki</a>. Deep theoretical
understanding of programming and type systems, <em>AND</em> one of the
best teachers of his generation. What a guy.</li>
<li><a href="../sam-ritchie/">Sam Ritchie</a></li>
<li><a href="../gerald-jay-sussman/">Gerald Jay Sussman</a></li>
</ol>
<p>But does Kent Beck himself break those rules? I’m guessing perhaps.
Because he seems to be a person who <em>on principle</em> breaks rules
to learn from breaking the rules.</p>
<p>“but cares about everything”? Yeah.</p>
<ol>
<li>My impression is that Kent Beck has very wide interests.</li>
<li>That <em>may</em> lead to him giving off more chaotic vibes than a
certain situation can handle.</li>
<li>I observe myself doing the same thing. In dialogue and work, I
sometimes jump to conclusions. In those situations, I rely on others
asking me to slow down.</li>
</ol>
<p>No value judgements here, just observing. Sometimes, chaotic is good.
Sometimes, systematic is good. I believe in people judging how they
should act for themselves!</p>
<p>Also, I have to remember that I cause this exact same confusion
(because I’ve seen it happen, and have had people comment to me that it
has happened!) I also tend to be a bit … rigid in my views on
epistemology. When people mistake something subjective for something
objective, I can respond a bit harshly. That can cuase problems.</p>

href="https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/issues/46">https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/issues/46</a>.
I’ve been assigned to the issue for four years. I’ve recently made
(subjectively) serious progress, but I’m hitting problems:</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.clerk.garden/teodorlu/lab/commit/5b54a0fa3e85c0ab71d2fa81d13c8acb1dad6946/src/steel_beams_si_units_clojure_multimethods/">https://github.clerk.garden/teodorlu/lab/commit/5b54a0fa3e85c0ab71d2fa81d13c8acb1dad6946/src/steel_beams_si_units_clojure_multimethods/</a></p>
<p><a href="../clerk/">Clerk</a> has been an essential tool to make
progress. Perhaps the only thing I need to do is <em>not</em> load the
system from within Clerk, and instead keep the SI system and the
documentation of the system separate. Dunno. Still working on this,
though. I feel like Sam is giving us so much, and I want to give
something back. I’m still grateful for the hour of pairing we did back
in 2020, which made me realize just how much I still had to learn. And
how interacting with generics in Emmy has opened my eyes to why Clojure
has built-in polymorphic dispatch (protocols/multimethods), and why <a
href="../software-design-for-flexibility/">Software Design for
Flexibility</a> is an awesome book.</p>

some problems last Sunday. <a href="../andrea-amantini/">Andrea

id="on-the-balance-between-design-and-implementation-when-we-build-software">On
the balance between design and implementation when we build
software</h3>
<p>X: “design”? You mean the work designers do?</p>
<p>T: No. I mean software design. I have a beef with the current usage
of the word “design”. We’re using it vaguely! I used to do design of
steel structures and design of concrete structures. These days I often
engage in software design.</p>
<p>I feel like the agile movement inadvertently dragged in an assumtion
that design is bad, and writing code is better. I think “don’t do
design, write code instead” is a <em>really bad idea</em>.</p>
<p>X: So … Why now?</p>
<p>T: I’m working with two great people. Having a lot of fun. But I feel
like we struggle a lot finding a balance between design and
implementation. Right now, we talk a lot about implementation details,
but <em>not</em> about system design.</p>
<p>X: Ah, I get it! You’re talking about architecture! Software
architecture!</p>
<p>T: 😅 I … have a bit of a beef with that word too.</p>
<p>X: why?</p>
<p>T: We software developers took the word “architecture” from civil
engineering projects, and I fear that we took the wrong word. In
software, we want to talk about the <em>core</em> of our system.
Architects <em>can do</em> the start of the work, if what you care about
is <em>floor plan utilization</em>, and the civil engineering is
trivial. Architects <em>do not</em> build bridges. Architects <em>do
not</em> build dams. Architects <em>do not</em> build industrial plants.
In those cases, the civil engineers (or construction engineers) hold the
“core”.</p>
<p>X: so … which word, then, if architecture is bad?</p>
<p>T: I think the word is “design”. And for systems, “system
design”!</p>
<p>X: okay. Man, when you <em>insist</em> on redefining words before you
even start speaking, it sometimes rubs be the wrong way. It’s like
everything I say is wrong, right?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, I know. Sorry about that. I don’t know of a better way —
other than leaning completely into the arts, presenting ideas as
theater, dialogue or as novels. Steal from <a
href="../eliyahu-goldratt/">Eliyahu Goldratt</a>’s way of presenting
things, perhaps.</p>
<p>X: yeah, yeah. I don’t always have time for that, you know?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, there’s <em>so much f-in stuff</em>. I feel like we could
make due with <em>less stuff</em>. But that requires some thinking.</p>
<p>X: So … What was that balance you mentioned? A balance between design
and implementation?</p>
<p>T: Right. Thanks. That was where we started.</p>
<p>We spend <em>so much time</em> on implementation and <em>so little
time on design</em>. And we’re calling it “agile”. “agile” as an excuse
for coding up things when we don’t have any idea why we have to do the
things we do. If we slow down, we might get pressure to speed up. It’s
lean to do less stuff. But rather than cut the problems we don’t care
about, we solve the problems we care about badly!</p>
<p>This is where design comes in. We should <em>know what our goal
is</em>. I’m … I’m at a point where I have no interest in writing code
unless the goal is clear.</p>
<p>X: what about teamwork? Everyone needs to know what do do, right?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, that’s the hard part. It’s harder to solve real problems
than write code. And it’s <em>even harder</em> when you’re a team. So
much shared context is needed.</p>
<p>X: So, what do we do?</p>
<p>T: I’m discovering this myself as I go along. I’ve had success with
two activities.</p>
<p>One activity is pair programming. This one is hard. Knowing when to
focus on design and when to focus on implementation is hard. I think
great pairing is something you have to re-learn every time you pair with
someone new. Without trust, this will simply fail. And that trust needs
to go both ways. I need to trust you, and you need to trust me.</p>
<p>Another activity is to use a decision matrix to compare approaches to
solve a problem. A decision matrix lets you do clean software design
work without getting stuck in all the details.</p>
<p>X: How should I learn pair programming?</p>
<p>T: Ideally, you get to pair with someone who is good at pair
programming. I had the chance to pair with <a
href="../lars-barlindhaug/">Lars Barlindhaug</a> in 2019 and <a
href="../oddmund-stromme/">Oddmund Strømme</a> in 2020. From Lars, I
learned that it’s better to organize your code into modules where each
module solves a problem you care about. From Oddmund, I learned that I
could work in smaller increments.</p>
<p>If you <em>do not</em> have someone you can learn pairing from on
your team, watch <a href="../magnar-sveen/">Magnar Sveen</a> and <a
href="../christian-johansen/">Christian Johansen</a> pair from their
youtube screencasts: <a
href="https://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/">https://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/</a></p>
<p>X: And … those decision matrices?</p>

matrices in <a href="../design-in-practice/">Design in Practice</a>.

<p>Yup. I just had spent some time off. That was absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Our family has a cabin 921 meters above the ocean. My (now deceased)
grandfather used to talk about how they used the cabin during the German
occupation of Norway in World War 2. German soldiers had “requisitioned”
clothing to stay warm. My grandfather never saw any of that clothing
again. But the Germans did leave some impressively detailed maps of the
area. I guess I should have taken a picture of that map, now? Too
late.</p>
<p>I love working with plaintext on my site. I don’t love how much
harder it is to include a simple image!</p>
<p>So, all those ideas. A person on the internet has been taking notes
in order to write their weeknotes. I figured I’d try. I’m including my
weeknotes-notes, in all their messy. Feel free to skip that list!</p>

<p>When I write, I <em>very often</em> get myself into scope creep. I
want to write about all the things! So far, timeboxing has saved my
weeknotes. And I’m 23 minutes into my timebox. I wanted to stick to 30
minutes. Let’s see how that goes.</p>
<h3 id="are-we-walking-too-quickly-when-we-create-software">Are we
walking too quickly when we create software?</h3>
<p>According to a youtube recording of a Thoughtworks guy, people walk
faster in bigger cities (until some limit). While that might be
interesting to know, is it <em>good</em> to walk fast? Should you get
done as soon as you can, or should you <em>not</em>?</p>
<p>I suspect that we should walk slower.</p>
<p>Do fewer things, so that we can do the things we do with pride.</p>
<p>I used to work in civil engineering. In that work, we had a set
amount of time to finish some piece of work. Looking back at that
experience, it was freeing. Yup, not stressful, freeing. Here is the
budget we have for this task. Try to hit it. If you’re way off, you may
have to simplify.</p>
<p>I do software, not civil these days. And I’ve said that estimates are
bad myself. But I feel like we’re maybe missing the point.</p>
<p>Estimating something if you don’t know what it is is silly. But being
explicit about how much effort we want to put into something makes sense
to me.</p>
<h3

<p>Trurl makes something, and is immediately caught in a dilemma. If he
<em>does</em> share it with Klapaucius, Klapaucius might embarrass Trurl
for its flaws, and open Trurl’s imperfection to the world. But if he
<em>does not</em> share it, nobody will know. Which is worse?</p>
<p>In <a href="../the-cyberiad/">The Cyberiad</a>, Trurl never ceases to

<h3 id="my-experience-of-a-team-buildingplanning-workshop-we-did">My
experience of a team-building/planning workshop we did</h3>
<p>I’m working with two great colleagues. One of my colleagues pointed
out that I might have some implicit expectations, and he’d like to know
what they were.</p>
<p>To address that, we spent two half-days together on Tuesday and
Wednesday.</p>
<p>I thought the workshop was for my co-workers, but in the end it was
tremendously useful for me. Which was weird!</p>
<p>I narrowed my expectations into:</p>
<ol>
<li>I expect us to make an effort to build trust in our team</li>
<li>I expect us to make an effort to build shared intent in our
team</li>
<li>I expect us to make an effort to build shared sense of quality in
our team</li>
<li>I expect us to know which organizational goals we are currently
working towards (OKRs)</li>
<li>I expect us to know how what we are doing today is influencing our
organizational goals (OKRs)</li>
</ol>
<p>But that’s kind of abstract. So we did something specific too. We
make a 2D “matrix” of skills and did a self-evaluation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two evaluations per person per skill: how comfortable are you doing
$SKILL, and what are your learning ambitions for $SKILL</li>
<li>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE.
<ul>
<li>Just use the whole scale, disambiguate between the things you’re
comfortable doing and the things you don’t know too well yet.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Things I learned during the workshop:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had assumed that everyone were interested in product management
(read eg <a href="../empowered/">Empowered</a> by <a
href="../marty-cagan/">Marty Cagan</a>)
<ol>
<li>That was wrong</li>
<li>I’m interested in product management, my co-workers want to focus on
code now, and perhaps think product later</li>
<li>Decision: I take responsibility for us doing reasonable things
product-wise.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I had assumed that I should be the one doing system design
<ol>
<li>That was wrong</li>
<li>Everyone were really interested in getting good at systems
design</li>
<li>Decision: I make sure we can be proud of our large-scale system
design, and try to push system work “down” where possible</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>So, this was super useful.</p>
<p>We wrote the list of skills by spending 5 minutes by ourselves
thinking about skills that had been relevant in previous software /
product work.</p>
<p>But why was it useful? What was the goal of that activity?</p>
<p>I think the goal was to build shared sense of quality. And I think
it’s easier to build shared sense of quality that just to build
quality</p>
<h3
id="i-think-its-easier-to-build-shared-sense-of-quality-than-just-to-build-quality">I
think it’s easier to build shared sense of quality than just to build
quality</h3>
<p>X: What does that even mean?</p>
<p>T: Let me give some context and explain why that statement has been
useful for me.</p>
<p>When we want to create something good, we need to engage in
<em>creativity</em>. In <a href="../creative-computation/">Creative
Computation</a>, <a href="../jack-rusher/">Jack Rusher</a> describes
creativity as a dual process between a generator and a filter. If you do
not have the time to watch his presentation, here is a simplified
ascii-representation of his figure:</p>
<pre><code>     DUAL PROCESS

  /------------------\
  |                  |
  v                  |

Generator         Filter
 Writer            Edtior
 Maker             Critic
 Creative          Discromitive

  |                  ^
  |                  |
  \------------------/
</code></pre>
<p>(please excuse my silly arrows.)</p>
<p>My summary of his model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creativity is a dual process</li>
<li>We make things</li>
<li>Then we judge whether they are any good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jack also cites <a href="../friedrich-nietzsche/">Friedrich
Nietzsche</a>, Ernest Hemingway and William James:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Creativity is born] of a rare cooperation between the “Dionysian”
spirit of ecstatic intoxication, which imbues the work with vitality and
passion, and the “Appolonian” spirit of sober restraint, which tempers
chaos with order and form.</p>
<p>—Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Write drunk, edit sober.</p>
<p>—Hemingway</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Creativity] involves the process of blind-variation and
selective-retention.</p>
<p>—William James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>X: OK, OK, that’s creativity. But where’s the shared sense of
quality?</p>
<p>T: If have created something in a Dionysian (drunk) manner, building
shared sense of quality with the people around you will likely force you
into taking the Appolonian (sober) perspective into account. I wrote
some code. I think it’s amazing. But I’m drunk, I don’t know whether
it’s any good yet. I’ll quckly realize that I’m actually drunk when I’m
completely unable to tell you why the code is any good.</p>
<p>X: So, we should talk about our taste, and about whether it’s any
good?</p>
<p>T: Absolutely! I find that rewarding, useful and fun. <a
href="../visakan-veerasamy/">Visakan Veerasamy</a> encourages people to
cultivate their taste in <a href="../friendly-ambitious-nerd/">friendly
ambitious nerd</a>. I think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p>X: Ok, ok. But what’s that “shared sense of quality”, then? How is
that different from pure quality?</p>
<p>T: Shared sense of quality is the understanding you and I build when
we discuss why the code is any good! And we don’t even have to agree
that it’s any good. Just need to build some shared understanding, shared
sense. I gain something by knowing whether you think it’s any good, you
gain something by knowing whether I think it’s any good. Win-win!</p>
<p>X: 🤔 Need to think on that I think. Perhaps try for myself to see if
I agree.</p>
