#+TITLE: Scicloj 2022-10: collective knowledge management

[[file:..][..]]

async questions later? ping @teodorlu in #babashka or #data-science or something on Clojurians Slack --- or @teodorheggelund on Twitter.

I'm really excited about this stuff!

* rationale
1. I'm interested in Scicloj and collective knowledge management
2. I'm excited about my current learning process
3. And I'm interested in helping others do the same.
* vision
scicloj knowledge archipelago

1. easy to create knowledge
2. easy to collect and curate knowledge
3. easy to learn.
* who is this guy?
used to do civil engineering (numerical analysis of nonlinear mechanics)

then software

these days mostly product

very interested in how we can build knowledge together.

(currently very much excited by [[id:dde82bbc-e4c8-49c0-b577-dba0cba0bdf7][The Beginning of Infinity]] by [[id:369abfa2-8b8c-4540-958f-d0fce79f132b][David Deutsch]])
* demo: =play.teod.eu=
Things I could show:

1. Create a new page, and deploy it
   1. Page for Daniel, perhaps?
2. Linking to other pages
3. the =play.clj relations= CLI

I'm going to emphasize "showing the whole" over "explaining how everything works".

#+begin_src shell-script
$ play.teod.eu-preview.sh
#+end_src
* terminology
1. [[id:0c9bef25-85ef-48e8-b4fd-d60160f177ec][play.teod.eu]] --- my knowledge playground / backyard / garden
2. [[id:f4762ab2-c1e5-4b90-9e59-be3ad6e6eafd][dbx]] --- "a collective knowledge toolkit for babashka zealots"
   1. dbx doesn't really exist yet outside my head
   2. but I want to pull out "some parts" of play.teod.eu for easy sharing.
* =play.teod.eu= tech --- "how does this work?"
(please jump in and ask questions, I'm not sure what people are interested in)

1. Lots of babashka
2. one folder for each document
   1. metadata in EDN files
      1. CLI for modifying metadata
   2. Embedding small HTML stuff is super easy
      1. Example: [[id:9eccb2aa-fe9a-4855-b0d3-8f89cbe1d825][Scicloj libraries and tools]]
3. no build step, HTML files in Git
4. a generated makefile
   1. makefile generation is painful.
      It's one big string, I want data.
   2. for dbx, I want pure babashka, no makefiles.
