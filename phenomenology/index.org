#+TITLE: Phenomenology

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Here's what I wrote for [[id:0ca0f3d5-ecae-40fe-9e79-2f24e6780079][Existentialism as a world view]]:

I'd like to understand phenomenology better.
Why?
It provides a model between objectivity and perception.

Things to do:

1. Create a list of sources.
   1. Heidegger?
2. Find some modern definitions of phenomenology
3. Figure out what I agree with.
