  A Rich-Hickey-simple solutions does not have unneccesary parts.
- The Clojure community's tendency to use host libraries directly rather than through wrappers.
  By avoiding the wrapper, we avoid one more source of problems.
  The mental model is /only/ the host library, not the host library /and/ it's wrapper library conventions.
