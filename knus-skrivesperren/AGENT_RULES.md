# Agent Ground Rules

1. **Code shall be tested.** Always run tests after writing code, don't assume it works.
2. **No frameworky code.** Plain Javascript is the game.
3. **Use ESM.** Use `import` and `export` syntax, not `require`. Set `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.
4. **Use Firefox.** When opening a browser or testing with a live browser, use Firefox.
5. **Norwegian labels.** All user-facing labels (buttons, headings, placeholders, messages, etc.) shall be in Norwegian.
6. **Tidy after edits.** Always tidy surrounding code after making edits.
7. **Relative links only.** `knus-skrivesperren` is served in a subfolder, not at `/`. All resource links must be relative (never start with `/`).

## Communication

1. Brief and subtle.
2. No insincere emotions.
3. Direct.
