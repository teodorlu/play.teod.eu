<p>The page in which I figure out whether Weeknotes (as argued for at <a
href="https://doingweeknotes.com/">https://doingweeknotes.com/</a>) is
something I want to do.</p>
<p>I found the concept through <a href="../patrick-dubroy/">Patrick
Dubroy</a>’s weeknotes: <a
href="https://github.com/pdubroy/weeknotes/blob/main/notes/2024-11.md">https://github.com/pdubroy/weeknotes/blob/main/notes/2024-11.md</a></p>

id="march-11th-to-march-16th">March 11th to March 16th</h2>
<p>After <em>yet another batch of structured thinking I fail to follow
up</em>, I decide to try again.</p>
<h3 id="why-weeknotes">Why weeknotes</h3>
<p>Weeknotes seem to hit a sweet spot. Once a week, I can do that. I can
even schedule time in my calendar!</p>
<h3 id="on-the-importance-of-learning-from-excellent-people">On the
importance of learning from excellent people</h3>
<p>The only reason whatsoever I’m doing this is because I’ve rigged my
Twitter account to follow a few highly competent people in detail. One
of those people I (subjectively) consider to be highly competent
(without ever having met the person) is <a
href="../patrick-dubroy/">Patrick Dubroy</a>. I caught a tweet in which
Patrick announced that he’d be writing weeknotes, and asked his Twitter
audience whether they would find it useful. I found it <em>very
interesting</em>. Utility will have to wait.</p>
<h3
id="the-best-way-to-find-excellent-people-is-through-trust-networks.">The
best way to find excellent people is through trust networks.</h3>
<p>Step 1: pick someone who you respect and believe you have something
to learn from.</p>
<p>Step 2: observe what they do, read what they write, answer when they
ask questions. Try to help them do things they care about.</p>
<p>Step 3 (the recursive step): explore <em>who they trust</em>. But do
this <em>slowly</em>. The recursive step will open you to get <em>more
content</em>, which is a double edged blade. If they are great and
you’ve read all they have written, great! This is exactly what you need.
If they are actually mediocre, stop. Full stop!</p>
<p>I started thinking about the importance of exploring networks of
trust about a year ago, when I made the frist version of this site (<a
href="../play.teod.eu/">play.teod.eu</a>). That lead me to make first
class support for remote references. Patricks’s page here on my site is
a remote reference. Technically, there’s a metadata file with</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">:form</span> <span class="at">:remote-reference</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>in it, found here: <a
href="https://github.com/teodorlu/play.teod.eu/blob/afc06c6954ee2782057b3bf6b2676a766aeb7d8a/patrick-dubroy/play.edn#L3">https://github.com/teodorlu/play.teod.eu/blob/afc06c6954ee2782057b3bf6b2676a766aeb7d8a/patrick-dubroy/play.edn#L3</a></p>
<p>but that’s not too important.</p>
<p>One of my main lessons from speaking at <a
href="../babashka-conf/">babashka-conf</a> (my talk was <a
href="../build-your-own-little-memex-with-babasha/">Build Your Own
Little Memex with Babashka</a>) was the importance of referring to
sources. And not in a literal “how to write papers” sense, in the
hypertext sense. With hypertext, we can refer effortlessly to sources at
any point in time. And that is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>By the way, I found Patrick by reading <a href="../jack-rusher/">Jack
Rusher</a>’s tweets. I interacted with Jack first on <a
href="../clojureverse/">Clojureverse</a>. I engaged with the Clojure
community on Clojureverse after realizing that the team I currently
worked on didn’t care too much about programming, and wanted to learn
more. I found Clojure kind of randomly by watching a Youtube video about
some guy doing REPL-connected Clojure programming with Emacs. And I
found Clojure sort of by accident after finding Haskell in 2014 (I did a
148 slide presentation about Haskell in Norwegian in 2024, <a
href="../haskell-hardt-og-godt/">Haskell: hardt og godt</a>, in English
something like “Learn Haskell the good, hard way”). And I don’t remember
how I stumbled upon Haskell, other than that I thought it was absolutely
amazing, and embarassing that we had spent so much time at <a
href="../ntnu/">NTNU</a> learning Java.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>I encourage you to look around for the people around you that you’d
like to learn something from, engage with them (take what they say
seriously, ask questions if you don’t think it makes sense, perhaps they
will respond), then dig deeper into the rabbit hole when you’ve got
energy.</p>
<h3
id="on-the-importance-of-slowing-down-and-sharing-knowledge-in-software-teams">On
the importance of slowing down and sharing knowledge in software
teams</h3>
<p>On my current team, we have lots of code, and very limited shared
understanding of that code.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that the right thing to do is to slow down and build
shared understanding.</p>
<p>Since joining the team, I’ve spent less than 5 % of my own time
writing code. I do like writing code, so I’d like to increase that
fraction over time. But I hate writing code that isn’t needed, or code
that solves the wrong problem.</p>
<p>So, let’s slow down! First, we build a solid shared understanding.
Then, later on, we’ll use that shared understanding as a foundation to
create &amp; capture value.</p>
<h3 id="kent-beck-knows-his-shit-but-cares-about-everything">Kent Beck
knows his shit, but cares about everything</h3>
<p>I had the fortune to chat briefly with <a href="../kent-beck/">Kent
Beck</a> when he visited Oslo in 2023. He gave a talk about the
importance of feeling safe to people working in <a
href="../iterate-as/">Iterate AS</a>. I felt like that was a bad topic /
audience match. Iterate is so awesome at creating a safe environment for
people that I feel like we struggle with actually expecting people to do
things. Anyway.</p>
<p>Kent Beck ran amazing software teams in the 90s, and wrote <a
href="../extreme-programming-book/">Extreme Programming (book)</a> about
the principles. The most important principle from that book that I had
not taken with sufficient seriousness before 2023 was pair programming,
and its generalization ensemble programming. Pairing is a ridiculously
effective tool to build shared intent. (which is one of the pillars in
my “product howto philosopy”, <a href="../tki-veiledning/">Tillit,
kvalitet og intensjon i praksis: en håndbok for produkt- og
programvareutvikling</a> (Norwegian)).</p>
<p>Kent Beck knew this 30 years ago, I learned it just yet. And it’s …
<em>really really weird</em> to fully lean into the importance of shared
intent. It’s <a href="../rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a>’s ideas from <a
href="../design-in-practice/">Design in Practice</a> taken to to level
9000. To make some ultra-clear directives:</p>
<ol>
<li>NEVER start writing code unless you know what problem you want to
solve.</li>
<li>NEVER start solving you problem unless you have at least two
different approaches.</li>
<li>ALWAYS share the problem and share your options before moving
on.</li>
</ol>
<p>These directives are divisive, and almost every team I’ve ever worked
on break them at every option.</p>
<p>Some people that <em>don’t</em> think are breaking those rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a> (kinda obvious? <a
href="../hammock-driven-development/">Hammock Driven Development</a> and
<a href="../design-in-practice/">Design in Practice</a> talk about this
directly)</li>
<li><a href="../stuart-halloway/">Stuart Halloway</a>, see <a
href="../debugging-with-the-scientific-method/">Debugging with the
Scientific Method</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../martin-kavalar/">Martin Kavalar</a> and <a
href="../jack-rusher/">Jack Rusher</a>: making <a
href="../clerk/">Clerk</a> so that we can explore options better</li>
<li><a href="../christian-johansen/">Christian Johansen</a> and <a
href="../magnar-sveen/">Magnar Sveen</a>: They’ve been pairing
effectively for <em>years</em>.</li>
<li><a href="../evan-czaplicki/">Evan Czaplicki</a>. Deep theoretical
understanding of programming and type systems, <em>AND</em> one of the
best teachers of his generation. What a guy.</li>
<li><a href="../sam-ritchie/">Sam Ritchie</a></li>
<li><a href="../gerald-jay-sussman/">Gerald Jay Sussman</a></li>
</ol>
<p>But does Kent Beck himself break those rules? I’m guessing perhaps.
Because he seems to be a person who <em>on principle</em> breaks rules
to learn from breaking rthose rules.</p>
<p>“but cares about everything”? Yeah.</p>
<ol>
<li>My impression is that Kent Beck has very wide interests.</li>
<li>That <em>may</em> lead to him giving off more chaotic vibes than a
certain situation can handle.</li>
<li>I observe myself doing the same thing. In dialogue and work, I
sometimes jump to conclusions. In those situations, I rely on others
asking me to slow down.</li>
</ol>
<p>No value judgements here, just observing. Sometimes, chaotic is good.
Sometimes, systematic is good. I believe in people judging how they
should act for themselves!</p>

<p><strong>My ultra-old (so far) failed attempt at adding SI units to <a
href="../emmy/">Emmy</a></strong>: <a
href="https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/issues/46">https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/issues/46</a>.
I’ve been assigned to the issue for four years. I’ve recently made
(subjectively) serious progress, but I’m hitting problems:</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.clerk.garden/teodorlu/lab/commit/5b54a0fa3e85c0ab71d2fa81d13c8acb1dad6946/src/steel_beams_si_units_clojure_multimethods/">https://github.clerk.garden/teodorlu/lab/commit/5b54a0fa3e85c0ab71d2fa81d13c8acb1dad6946/src/steel_beams_si_units_clojure_multimethods/</a></p>
<p><a href="../clerk/">Clerk</a> has been an essential tool to make
progress. Perhaps the only thing I need to do is <em>not</em> load the
system from within Clerk, and instead keep the SI system and the
documentation of the system separate. Dunno. Still working on this,
though. I feel like Sam is giving us so much, and I want to give
something back. I’m still grateful for the hour of pairing we did back
in 2020, which made me realize just how much I still had to learn. And
how interacting with generics in Emmy has opened my eyes to why Clojure
has built-in polymorphic dispatch (protocols/multimethods), and why <a
href="../software-design-for-flexibility/">Software Design for
Flexibility</a> is an awesome book.</p>
<p><strong>Helping the Clerk team debug problems</strong>. I reported
some problems last Sunday. <a href="../andrea-amantini/">Andrea
Amantini</a> took the trouble of digging into those problems. And he
probably discovered that I had hit not one, but two different problems,
and reported both at once. He asked for some follow-up (while I was in
some meeting), and I haven’t been able to answer yet.</p>
<p><strong>Still curious about running Clojure directly in
Emacs</strong>. <a href="../jack-rusher/">Jack Rusher</a> started out:
<a
href="https://github.com/jackrusher/scimacs">https://github.com/jackrusher/scimacs</a>.
I <em>presume</em> he wanted to encourage someone to try explore this
further, because I <em>presume</em> that he has many options on his
hands. I <em>tried</em> doing some work there, but quickly got
stuck:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t know C (well enough).</li>
<li>Embedding one language into another through FFI bindings is
something I find hard (subjectively).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="selected-gratitude">Selected gratitude</h3>
<p>I’ve had the pleasure to get to work more with <a
href="../olav-moseng/">Olav Moseng</a>. Olav and <a
href="../ruben-sevaldson/">Ruben Sevaldson</a> gratiously helped making
last week’s Clojure workshops happen. (The material for those workshops
are not yet public, but I’ve gotten all OKs I need, and will publish, I
promise!)</p>
<p><a href="../michiel-borkent/">Michiel Borkent</a> helps everyone from
scratch as always, continuing to be a one man bulldozer army lifting us
all up.</p>
<p><a href="../tonsky/">Nikita Prokopov</a> continutes to be a one man
(slightly smaller bulldozer army — but one that also cares deeply about
design).</p>
<p>Jørgen, Ann and Viktor continue to see problems clearly, and
similarly care deeply about the people they empower to solve those
probelms.</p>
<p><a href="../thusan-arul/">Thusan Arul</a> and <a
href="../magnus-rr/">Magnus Reier Rushfeldt</a> for picking up <em>my
slack</em> on the <a href="../tidy-first/">Tidy First</a> book club.</p>
<p><a href="../finn-holme/">Finn Holme</a> and <a
href="id:702B0D17-E25B-4784-BF60-28965A545D30">Adrian Tofting</a> for
honestly, shamelessly being themselves.</p>
