#+TITLE: A list of failure modes from bad intersections between work and play

[[file:..][..]]

Play is dynamic, work is static.
That's how I view it.
When we play, we move in unsurprising ways.
Imagine a playground where a dozen eight-year-olds are playing.
Are you able to predict what's going to happen in half an hour?
Even in ten minutes?

When we play, we let our mind wander.
We ease some constraints.

I believe the act of designing the boundary between work and play is tremendously important.
I wrote about this in [[id:c62978a1-8081-4d44-9af4-93327f387085][Static-dynamic interaction]] in 2018, and I can't get the topic out of my mind.
Play alone does not suffice.
Work alone does not suffice.
We need both, and they must be balanced.
