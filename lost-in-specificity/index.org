#+title: Lost in specificity

[[./..][..]]

If everything we do must be specific, there's a limit to the ideas we can have.
When a two-week sprint is our only tool, we will simply have to disregard anything that doesn't fit in a two week box.
It's a bed of Procrustes.
All limbs that don't fit in the bed are cut off.
Should I re-read that Taleb book?
Hmm.
