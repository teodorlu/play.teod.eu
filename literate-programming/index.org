#+TITLE: Literate Programming

[[file:..][..]]

A programming discipline in which one writes programs that can be executed and read by humans from top to bottom.
When I face a hard programming problem, I like to use [[id:9799d27f-49d0-414a-bb94-f611588fc85c][Clerk]] to explore the topic interactively.
Literate programming with Clerk makes the problems more tangible for me than blind symbol manipulation.
