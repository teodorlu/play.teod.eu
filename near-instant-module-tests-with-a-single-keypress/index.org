#+TITLE: Near-instant Module Tests with a Single Keypress

[[file:..][..]]

Six weeks ago, I started working for the Norwegian Safety REF with Christian Johansen REF and Magnar Sveen REF.
I feel fortunate to be in this situation: I like working with resourceful pepople, and I believe I have a lot to learn from Christian and Magnar.
You may know Christian and Magnar from zombie-clj REF, a Clojure(Script) screencast where they make a game from scratch.

Learning means discovering what other peoeple do and believe that you don't know, do or pay attention to.
The one part of Christian and Magnar's development workflow that has had the largest impact on my own thinking is near-instant module tests with a single keypress.
