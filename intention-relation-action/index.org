#+title: Intent, Relationships, Action

[[./..][..]]

1. Intent
2. Relationships
3. Action

Be intentional in what you do.
If you cannot execute with intent, don't do it.
Don't just follow the herd.
Prefer explicit choices.
Don't empty your reserves for something you don't believe in.

Your relationships are valuable.
Remember that.
How can you prioritize the humans around you?
What are their values?
What are their perspectives?

When intent is clear and relationships are cared for, take action.
Go out, and change what is.
Reflection has it's place.
But an idea is stranded if it's stuck in reflection.
Take it into action to give it a chance to become what it should become.
