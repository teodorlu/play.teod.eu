TODO remember to comment the video back in when complete.
While writing, I just want some faster page loads.

I've come to despise the creation of stress when stress is not required.

I realize that this is context dependent.
A real pursuit towards zero stress requires extraordinary levels of trust, shared vision and shared sense of quality.

They just are.
Frankly, they remove stress.
For me, at least.

Which is why I'm writing content here.
I use the same approach for my Linux system.
Can I improve it?
I'd rather have incomplete parts than inability to move forward.
