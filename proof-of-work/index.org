#+TITLE: proof of work

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Are you trying to make something happen?
Are you looking for the smart way out?
The way you can get away with minimal effort?
Then, when you try to get others to do your thing, they ... don't?

If you tell kids that they have stay in line, they will tell other kids that the other kids have to stay in line.

As humans, we don't rely purely on analysis of information.
We also judge effort.
Effort signals significance.
Where are we putting our work?
Are we getting any impact from the effort?

Instead of looking for the hack, consider doing the work and sharing the proof of that work.
