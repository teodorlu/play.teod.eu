Is Weeknotes (see https://doingweeknotes.com/) is something I want to do?

After /yet another batch of structured thinking I fail to follow up/, I decide to try again with a different format, a different trigger and a different scope.

I found the concept through [[id:26cf5980-b789-49a9-9418-3ac1887809fc][Patrick Dubroy]]'s weeknotes:
https://github.com/pdubroy/weeknotes/blob/main/notes/2024-11.md

** Why weeknotes
Weeknotes seem to hit a sweet spot.
Once a week, I can do that.
I can even schedule time in my calendar!

** On the importance of learning from excellent people
The only reason whatsoever I'm doing this is because I've rigged my Twitter account to follow a few highly competent people in detail.
One of those people I (subjectively) consider to be highly competent (without ever having met the person) is [[id:26cf5980-b789-49a9-9418-3ac1887809fc][Patrick Dubroy]].
I caught a tweet in which Patrick announced that he'd be writing weeknotes, and asked his Twitter audience whether they would find it useful.
I found it /very interesting/.
Utility will have to wait.

** The best way to find excellent people is through trust networks.
Step 1: pick someone who you respect and believe you have something to learn from.

Step 2: observe what they do, read what they write, answer when they ask questions.
Try to help them do things they care about.

Step 3 (the recursive step): explore /who they trust/.
But do this /slowly/.
The recursive step will open you to get /more content/, which is a double edged blade.
If they are great and you've read all they have written, great!
This is exactly what you need.
If they are actually mediocre, stop.
Full stop!

I started thinking about the importance of exploring networks of trust about a year ago, when I made the frist version of this site ([[id:0c9bef25-85ef-48e8-b4fd-d60160f177ec][play.teod.eu]]).
That lead me to make first class support for remote references.
Patricks's page here on my site is a remote reference.
Technically, there's a metadata file with

#+begin_src clojure
 :form :remote-reference
#+end_src

in it, found here:
https://github.com/teodorlu/play.teod.eu/blob/afc06c6954ee2782057b3bf6b2676a766aeb7d8a/patrick-dubroy/play.edn#L3

but that's not too important.

One of my main lessons from speaking at [[id:cfe0cbd0-b1cb-4aeb-9322-6694bb18e2f9][babashka-conf]] (my talk was [[id:26776cc4-e64d-494b-b24c-784b2c57866d][Build Your Own Little Memex with Babashka]]) was the importance of referring to sources.
And not in a literal "how to write papers" sense, in the hypertext sense.
With hypertext, we can refer effortlessly to sources at any point in time.
And that is absolutely amazing.

By the way, I found Patrick by reading [[id:4ba42678-1667-426d-a07f-dfe96ab46bd2][Jack Rusher]]'s tweets.
I interacted with Jack first on [[id:57221ffb-132c-4348-8ba4-5df6cff915d3][Clojureverse]].
I engaged with the Clojure community on Clojureverse after realizing that the team I currently worked on didn't care too much about programming, and wanted to learn more.
I found Clojure kind of randomly by watching a Youtube video about some guy doing REPL-connected Clojure programming with Emacs.
And I found Clojure sort of by accident after finding Haskell in 2014 (I did a 148 slide presentation about Haskell in Norwegian in 2014, [[id:AE1427D5-AD4D-42B5-A971-E01E62D3D958][Haskell: hardt og godt]], in English something like "Learn Haskell the good, hard way").
And I don't remember how I stumbled upon Haskell, other than that I thought it was absolutely amazing, and embarassing that we had spent so much time at [[id:041EBF1E-41ED-426E-957D-DB2A9860B794][NTNU]] learning Java.

I digress.

I encourage you to look around for the people around you that you'd like to learn something from, engage with them (take what they say seriously, ask questions if you don't think it makes sense, perhaps they will respond), then dig deeper into the rabbit hole when you've got energy.
** On the importance of slowing down and sharing knowledge in software teams
On my current team, we have lots of code, and limited shared understanding of that code.

I'm convinced that the right thing to do is to slow down and build shared understanding.

Since joining the team, I've spent less than 5 % of my own time writing code.
I do like writing code, so I'd like to increase that fraction over time.
But I hate writing code that isn't needed, or code that solves the wrong problem.

So, let's slow down!
First, we build a solid shared understanding.
Then, later on, we'll use that shared understanding as a foundation to create & capture value.
** Kent Beck knows his shit, but cares about everything
I had the fortune to chat briefly with [[id:9A98EB07-B6D8-4A64-AB1A-4E32F8722272][Kent Beck]] when he visited Oslo in 2023.
He gave a talk about the importance of feeling safe to people working in [[id:A6B0A30E-7B73-44E1-A027-F1087CDD8304][Iterate AS]].
I felt like that was a bad topic / audience match.
Iterate is so awesome at creating a safe environment for people that I feel like we struggle with actually expecting people to do things.
Anyway.

Kent Beck ran amazing software teams in the 90s, and wrote [[id:B8C15136-516B-4753-B6AC-072640B9B99F][Extreme Programming (book)]] about the principles.
The most important principle from that book that I had not taken with sufficient seriousness before 2023 was pair programming, and its generalization ensemble programming.
Pairing is a ridiculously effective tool to build shared intent.
(which is one of the pillars in my "product howto philosopy", [[id:529da36c-168f-4698-866f-bba64a5c13c5][Tillit, kvalitet og intensjon i praksis: en h√•ndbok for produkt- og programvareutvikling]] (Norwegian)).

Kent Beck knew this 30 years ago, I learned it just yet.
And it's ... /really really weird/ to fully lean into the importance of shared intent.
It's [[id:a172782b-bceb-4b44-afdf-7a2348d02970][Rich Hickey]]'s ideas from [[id:7e831e40-daa5-4714-9ba5-c9e08988ce55][Design in Practice]] taken to to level 9000.
To make some ultra-clear directives:

1. NEVER start writing code unless you know what problem you want to solve.
2. NEVER start solving you problem unless you have at least two different approaches.
3. ALWAYS share the problem and share your options before moving on.

These directives are divisive, and almost every team I've ever worked on break them at every option.

Some people that I /don't/ think are breaking those rules:

1. [[id:a172782b-bceb-4b44-afdf-7a2348d02970][Rich Hickey]] (kinda obvious?
   [[id:39291BEF-2047-48E8-BA21-6CCEF5F2FF90][Hammock Driven Development]] and [[id:7e831e40-daa5-4714-9ba5-c9e08988ce55][Design in Practice]] talk about this directly)
2. [[id:E54C0804-7AC9-4ABB-9F5B-5C0B1584030D][Stuart Halloway]], see [[id:DC315E58-F594-42D5-9FA0-D157A2F30503][Debugging with the Scientific Method]].
3. [[id:63922b15-01b3-4a03-afe1-18c8ef0fa8f4][Martin Kavalar]] and [[id:4ba42678-1667-426d-a07f-dfe96ab46bd2][Jack Rusher]]: making [[id:9799d27f-49d0-414a-bb94-f611588fc85c][Clerk]] so that we can explore options better
4. [[id:05a34792-5bd2-43d6-8c0f-6ca62c01b626][Christian Johansen]] and [[id:6d36df4a-c172-460d-a9cf-8e6ee5d386c8][Magnar Sveen]]: They've been pairing effectively for /years/.
5. [[id:26C2B24B-CF52-4C76-B9C5-E86FA7EAF9E5][Evan Czaplicki]].
   Deep theoretical understanding of programming and type systems, /AND/ one of the best teachers of his generation.
   What a guy.
6. [[id:6455f952-018a-497a-bfc1-69774f26946a][Sam Ritchie]]
7. [[id:b726cfb2-5aff-46e7-b377-c881af59753d][Gerald Jay Sussman]]

But does Kent Beck himself break those rules?
I'm guessing perhaps.
Because he seems to be a person who /on principle/ breaks rules to learn from breaking the rules.

"but cares about everything"?
Yeah.

1. My impression is that Kent Beck has very wide interests.
2. That /may/ lead to him giving off more chaotic vibes than a certain situation can handle.
3. I observe myself doing the same thing.
   In dialogue and work, I sometimes jump to conclusions.
   In those situations, I rely on others asking me to slow down.

No value judgements here, just observing.
Sometimes, chaotic is good.
Sometimes, systematic is good.
I believe in people judging how they should act for themselves!

Also, I have to remember that I cause this exact same confusion (because I've seen it happen, and have had people comment to me that it has happened!)
I also tend to be a bit ... rigid in my views on epistemology.
When people mistake something subjective for something objective, I can respond a bit harshly.
That can cuase problems.
** Paths not taken (yet)
*My ultra-old (so far) failed attempt at adding SI units to [[id:CF00FC4F-2839-4A6C-B190-FE9259670CD3][Emmy]]*: https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/issues/46.
I've been assigned to the issue for four years.
I've recently made (subjectively) serious progress, but I'm hitting problems:

https://github.clerk.garden/teodorlu/lab/commit/5b54a0fa3e85c0ab71d2fa81d13c8acb1dad6946/src/steel_beams_si_units_clojure_multimethods/

[[id:9799d27f-49d0-414a-bb94-f611588fc85c][Clerk]] has been an essential tool to make progress.
Perhaps the only thing I need to do is /not/ load the system from within Clerk, and instead keep the SI system and the documentation of the system separate.
Dunno.
Still working on this, though.
I feel like Sam is giving us so much, and I want to give something back.
I'm still grateful for the hour of pairing we did back in 2020, which made me realize just how much I still had to learn.
And how interacting with generics in Emmy has opened my eyes to why Clojure has built-in polymorphic dispatch (protocols/multimethods), and why [[id:29d152b9-9f5e-4c23-904a-f926b3d83477][Software Design for Flexibility]] is an awesome book.

*Helping the Clerk team debug problems*.
I reported some problems last Sunday.
[[id:EC36679E-E0F0-4222-B40D-1F7FD53CC7D9][Andrea Amantini]] took the trouble of digging into those problems.
And he probably discovered that I had hit not one, but two different problems, and reported both at once.
He asked for some follow-up (while I was in some meeting), and I haven't been able to answer yet.

*Still curious about running Clojure directly in Emacs*.
[[id:4ba42678-1667-426d-a07f-dfe96ab46bd2][Jack Rusher]] started out: https://github.com/jackrusher/scimacs.
I /presume/ he wanted to encourage someone to try explore this further, because I /presume/ that he has many options on his hands.
I /tried/ doing some work there, but quickly got stuck:

1. I don't know C (well enough).
2. Embedding one language into another through FFI bindings is something I find hard (subjectively).
** Selected gratitude
I've had the pleasure to get to work more with [[id:CDD3941A-12F8-414E-8B76-29BC5B5E8D4E][Olav Moseng]].
Olav and [[id:CF4A09A7-23CA-4133-A556-6494359BA3C1][Ruben Sevaldson]] gratiously helped making last week's Clojure workshops happen.
(The material for those workshops are not yet public, but I've gotten all OKs I need, and will publish, I promise!)

[[id:7688bf50-5c2c-49b2-9efc-fcf21a539af4][Michiel Borkent]] helps everyone from scratch as always, continuing to be a one man bulldozer army lifting us all up.

[[id:96C0714D-743C-4BA3-83F9-214F5DEF36D1][Nikita Prokopov]] continutes to be a one man (slightly smaller) bulldozer army --- but one that cares deeply about design.

J√∏rgen, Ann and Viktor continue to see problems clearly, and similarly care deeply about the people they empower to solve those problems.

[[id:9A9398C9-2FB8-4758-AE12-E3B381B5E191][Thusan Arul]] and [[id:28567529-36DC-4FB7-98B7-993C80B49F8D][Magnus Reier Rushfeldt]] for picking up /my slack/ on the [[id:84F69DED-CD12-4051-A441-BF3B99641A69][Tidy First]] book club.

[[id:E2AEC445-ECD1-4A09-89E9-B577EDC4B1F3][Finn Holme]] and [[id:565f1ed6-dbd1-466f-9592-5b045d4a9753][Adrian Tofting]] for honestly, shamelessly being themselves.

[[id:F27778B8-1C99-4438-B3FD-602AE258C748][Richard Tingstad]] for some really enjoyable interactions & par programming sessionds last week.
** Short retrospective, should I do more weeknotes?
1. I really liked the process
2. Finding the right target audience was a bit hard.
   I landed on writing two docs: one for my team, and one for me.
   You're reading the one that's for me.
3. I spent about two hours on the one for me, and about two hours for the one for my team.
   I probably want to aim to use /less time/.
   Four hours per week is 10 % of total spent time.
   Probably not a sustainable amount.
4. I've got no idea whatsoever what others are going to think about me writing this, really curious.
   I'd appreciate it if you'd send me reactions you have.
5. I wonder if I want to publish a link to my weeknotes on Twitter?
   Perhaps yersss?
6. I have too many spelling errors in this text.
   I need to get spell checking in Emacs working again.
   üòî

OK, done.
Time to get some air.
Untill next time!

** On the importance of having great people to learn from
Every day that passes, I cherish my chances to learn from /great people/.
They are out there!
They might just be ... hard to find.
And /who/ you should be learning from is intimitely related to /what your goals are/.
Those I enjoy learning from may not be the right people for you to learn from.

** On the balance between design and implementation when we build software
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4be84107-beb5-4d15-af06-f6a6f721fa63
:END:

X: "design"?
You mean the work designers do?

T: No.
I mean software design.
I have a beef with the current usage of the word "design".
We're using it vaguely!
I used to do design of steel structures and design of concrete structures.
These days I often engage in software design.

I feel like the agile movement inadvertently dragged in an assumtion that design is bad, and writing code is better.
I think "don't do design, write code instead" is a /really bad idea/.

X: So ...
Why now?

T: I'm working with two great people.
Having a lot of fun.
But I feel like we struggle a lot finding a balance between design and implementation.
Right now, we talk a lot about implementation details, but /not/ about system design.

X: Ah, I get it!
You're talking about architecture!
Software architecture!

T: üòÖ
I ... have a bit of a beef with that word too.

X: why?

T: We software developers took the word "architecture" from civil engineering projects, and I fear that we took the wrong word.
In software, we want to talk about the /core/ of our system.
Architects /can do/ the start of the work, if what you care about is /floor plan utilization/, and the civil engineering is trivial.
Architects /do not/ build bridges.
Architects /do not/ build dams.
Architects /do not/ build industrial plants.
In those cases, the civil engineers (or construction engineers) hold the "core".

X: so ... which word, then, if architecture is bad?

T: I think the word is "design".
And for systems, "system design"!

X: okay.
Man, when you /insist/ on redefining words before you even start speaking, it sometimes rubs be the wrong way.
It's like everything I say is wrong, right?

T: Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.
I don't know of a better way --- other than leaning completely into the arts, presenting ideas as theater, dialogue or as novels.
Steal from [[id:97de0013-e7d3-429e-bf06-1a4bfca5d184][Eliyahu Goldratt]]'s way of presenting things, perhaps.

X: yeah, yeah.
I don't always have time for that, you know?

T: Yeah, there's /so much f-in stuff/.
I feel like we could make due with /less stuff/.
But that requires some thinking.

X: So ...
What was that balance you mentioned?
A balance between design and implementation?

T: Right.
Thanks.
That was where we started.

We spend /so much time/ on implementation and /so little time on design/.
And we're calling it "agile".
"agile" as an excuse for coding up things when we don't have any idea why we have to do the things we do.
If we slow down, we might get pressure to speed up.
It's lean to do less stuff.
But rather than cut the problems we don't care about, we solve the problems we care about badly!

This is where design comes in.
We should /know what our goal is/.
I'm ...
I'm at a point where I have no interest in writing code unless the goal is clear.

X: what about teamwork?
Everyone needs to know what do do, right?

T: Yeah, that's the hard part.
It's harder to solve real problems than write code.
And it's /even harder/ when you're a team.
So much shared context is needed.

X: So, what do we do?

T: I'm discovering this myself as I go along.
I've had success with two activities.

One activity is pair programming.
This one is hard.
Knowing when to focus on design and when to focus on implementation is hard.
I think great pairing is something you have to re-learn every time you pair with someone new.
Without trust, this will simply fail.
And that trust needs to go both ways.
I need to trust you, and you need to trust me.

Another activity is to use a decision matrix to compare approaches to solve a problem.
A decision matrix lets you do clean software design work without getting stuck in all the details.

X: How should I learn pair programming?

T: Ideally, you get to pair with someone who is good at pair programming.
I had the chance to pair with [[id:BC86AE82-0612-4073-B9DF-C0A6625CBEBF][Lars Barlindhaug]] in 2019 and [[id:8833ff2f-ed66-4db2-ac14-6f8eff9f70d4][Oddmund Str√∏mme]] in 2020.
From Lars, I learned that it's better to organize your code into modules where each module solves a problem you care about.
From Oddmund, I learned that I could work in smaller increments.

If you /do not/ have someone you can learn pairing from on your team, watch [[id:6d36df4a-c172-460d-a9cf-8e6ee5d386c8][Magnar Sveen]] and [[id:05a34792-5bd2-43d6-8c0f-6ca62c01b626][Christian Johansen]] pair from their youtube screencasts:
https://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/

X: And ... those decision matrices?

T: Watch [[id:a172782b-bceb-4b44-afdf-7a2348d02970][Rich Hickey]] explain decision matrices in [[id:7e831e40-daa5-4714-9ba5-c9e08988ce55][Design in Practice]].
Then try it out with your team!

** My head is too full of thoughts, I struggle to narrow into weeknotes.
Yup.
I just had spent some time off.
That was absolutely amazing.

Our family has a cabin 921 meters above the ocean.
My (now deceased) grandfather used to talk about how they used the cabin during the German occupation of Norway in World War 2.
German soldiers had "requisitioned" clothing to stay warm.
My grandfather never saw any of that clothing again.
But the Germans did leave some impressively detailed maps of the area.
I guess I should have taken a picture of that map, now?
Too late.

I love working with plaintext on my site.
I don't love how much harder it is to include a simple image!

So, all those ideas.
A person on the internet has been taking notes in order to write their weeknotes.
I figured I'd try.
I'm including my weeknotes-notes, in all their messy.
Feel free to skip that list!

- Cross country skate skiing requires hip mobility
- Two makers and their egos: Trurl and K
- Scenes of creators, for creators: writing is not the /thing/ unless the creators are writers!
- Knowledge is additative, direction is subtractive
- vacation builds motivation!
- vacation is for /wide/ discovery, the opposite of narrow focus
- In teamwork, it matters not what any one individual knows, it's the knowledge of the group that matters.
  - To lean effectively on the "knowledge of the group", we must know what others know
  - "knowing what others know" is named "transitive memory systems" in literature
  - In my arrogance, I wish it was named "/transitive/ memory systems".
    - But that may not be the right word either.
- dense linking vs free-form thinking
  - I like densely linked hypertext document.
    They smell "good like wikipedia-good".
  - yet, when I write, I prefer writing from a place where I am /not/ considering my references.
- theory should be built in hypertext
- are we walking too quickly when we create software?

phew.

When I write, I /very often/ get myself into scope creep.
I want to write about all the things!
So far, timeboxing has saved my weeknotes.
And I'm 23 minutes into my timebox.
I wanted to stick to 30 minutes.
Let's see how that goes.
** Are we walking too quickly when we create software?
According to a youtube recording of a Thoughtworks guy, people walk faster in bigger cities (until some limit).
While that might be interesting to know, is it /good/ to walk fast?
Should you get done as soon as you can, or should you /not/?

I suspect that we should walk slower.

Do fewer things, so that we can do the things we do with pride.

I used to work in civil engineering.
In that work, we had a set amount of time to finish some piece of work.
Looking back at that experience, it was freeing.
Yup, not stressful, freeing.
Here is the budget we have for this task.
Try to hit it.
If you're way off, you may have to simplify.

I do software, not civil these days.
And I've said that estimates are bad myself.
But I feel like we're maybe missing the point.

Estimating something if you don't know what it is is silly.
But being explicit about how much effort we want to put into something makes sense to me.
** Trurl and Klapaucius: two makers, their egos, and their tiny scene
Trurl makes something, and is immediately caught in a dilemma.
If he /does/ share it with Klapaucius, Klapaucius might embarrass Trurl for its flaws, and open Trurl's imperfection to the world.
But if he /does not/ share it, nobody will know.
Which is worse?

In [[id:f0cc1954-5570-481e-9884-a6b7edb58358][The Cyberiad]], Trurl never ceases to share with Klapaucius.

The book was published in 1965, which makes me wonder how it can resemble two grumpy old developers.
** Joy in cutting scope?
My timebox is out!
That's actually kind of nice.
I can finish.
I don't have to write about everything.
This is not a report.
I can actually /decide/ that this is not a report, this is some stuff I write for myself.
And that's something I like!

** My experience of a team-building/planning workshop we did
I'm working with two great colleagues.
One of my colleagues pointed out that I might have some implicit expectations about how we should work together, and he'd like to know what they were.

To address that, we spent two half-days together on Tuesday and Wednesday.

I thought the workshop was for my co-workers, but in the end it was tremendously useful for me.
Which was weird!

I narrowed my expectations into:

1. I expect us to make an effort to build trust in our team
2. I expect us to make an effort to build shared intent in our team
3. I expect us to make an effort to build shared sense of quality in our team
4. I expect us to know which organizational goals we are currently working towards
5. I expect us to know how what we are doing today is influencing our organizational goals

But that's kind of abstract.
So we did something specific too.
We make a 2D "matrix" of skills and did a self-evaluation.

- Two evaluations per person per skill: how comfortable are you doing $SKILL, and what are your learning ambitions for $SKILL
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE.
  - Just use the whole scale, disambiguate between the things you're comfortable doing and the things you don't know too well yet.

Things I learned during the workshop:

1. I had assumed that everyone were interested in product management (read eg [[id:4c96fb35-ee33-4386-b2b8-f7b80cd5d8a5][Empowered]] by [[id:45f5cc28-79f9-4a88-930f-06f77e727479][Marty Cagan]])
   1. That was wrong
   2. I'm interested in product management, my co-workers want to focus on code now, and perhaps think product later
   3. Decision: I take responsibility for us doing reasonable things product-wise.
2. I had assumed that I should be the one doing system design
   1. That was wrong
   2. Everyone were really interested in getting good at systems design
   3. Decision: I make sure we can be proud of our large-scale system design, and try to push system work "down" where possible

So, this was super useful.

We wrote the list of skills by spending 5 minutes by ourselves thinking about skills that had been relevant in previous software / product work.

But why was it useful?
What was the goal of that activity?

I think the goal was to build shared sense of quality.
And I think it's easier to build shared sense of quality that just to build quality
** I think it's easier to build shared sense of quality than just to build quality
X: What does that even mean?

T: Let me give some context and explain why that statement has been useful for me.

When we want to create something good, we need to engage in /creativity/.
In [[id:747d8b1e-5048-44f0-bd97-ef9a7de2fddd][Creative Computation]], [[id:4ba42678-1667-426d-a07f-dfe96ab46bd2][Jack Rusher]] describes creativity as a dual process between a generator and a filter.
If you do not have the time to watch his presentation, here is a simplified ascii-representation of his figure:

#+begin_src
           DUAL PROCESS

        /------------------\
        |                  |
        v                  |

      Generator         Filter
       Writer            Edtior
       Maker             Critic
       Creative          Discromitive

        |                  ^
        |                  |
        \------------------/
#+end_src

(please excuse my silly arrows.)

My summary of his model:

1. Creativity is a dual process
2. We make things
3. Then we judge whether they are any good.

Jack also cites [[id:72EA74E8-9AD5-44CF-B20E-C96C4AD93F75][Friedrich Nietzsche]], Ernest Hemingway and William James:

#+begin_quote
[Creativity is born] of a rare cooperation between the "Dionysian"
spirit of ecstatic intoxication, which imbues the work with vitality
and passion, and the "Appolonian" spirit of sober restraint, which
tempers chaos with order and form.

---Nietzsche
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Write drunk, edit sober.

---Hemingway
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
[Creativity] involves the process of blind-variation and selective-retention.

---William James
#+end_quote

X: OK, OK, that's creativity.
But where's the shared sense of quality?

T: If have created something in a Dionysian (drunk) manner, building shared sense of quality with the people around you will likely force you into taking the Appolonian (sober) perspective into account.
I wrote some code.
I think it's amazing.
But I'm drunk, I don't know whether it's any good yet.
I'll quckly realize that I'm actually drunk when I'm completely unable to tell you why the code is any good.

X: So, we should talk about our taste, and about whether it's any good?

T: Absolutely!
I find that rewarding, useful and fun.
[[id:5172319f-ed46-4520-a7f2-b68359e69aca][Visakan Veerasamy]] encourages people to cultivate their taste in [[id:57341ad1-065a-4652-979d-61887803aabf][friendly ambitious nerd]].
I think that's a good idea.

X: Ok, ok.
But what's that "shared sense of quality", then?
How is that different from pure quality?

T: Shared sense of quality is the understanding you and I build when we discuss why the code is any good!
And we don't even have to agree that it's any good.
Just need to build some shared understanding, shared sense.
I gain something by knowing whether you think it's any good, you gain something by knowing whether I think it's any good.
Win-win!

X: ü§î
Need to think on that I think.
Perhaps try for myself to see if I agree.

- being generally awesome
- helping out
- bearing with me on my weird tangents and sometimes trying out my weird ideas.
