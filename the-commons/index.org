#+TITLE: The Commons

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

The commons is the place we share.
It is the place that is not within the domination of an individual.
It is the place governed not by the will of one, but by the collective.
No one dominates the other.

Who enters the commons?
Research into common spaces (refer to that Nobel Prize economics essay from the 70s) suggests that there must be rules for who can enter the commons.
Otherwise, the commons may end in tragedy.

Commons give us meaning.
It is in shared spaces that we understand who we are.
It is in shared spaces we can see who we are.
