structure:

1. Temporally indexed by date
2. For each reference capture properties.
	1. target URL or remote reference on play
	2. where I discovered the link
		1. Where did I find the link?
		2. Who made the thing where I found it?
	3. Target resource creation date
	4. Reference date (same as toplevel date)

Not sure what kind of capture mechanism I want for this.
I definitely want something easier than a plaintext doc.
