#+title: narrow-statements

Idea

Coordination is easier when statements are narrow

Narrow /interpreted/ statements requires

  Statement is composed of narrow pieces

  Context where statement is interpreted is aware of the pieces

Challenge - building new language.

Should new language pieces be introduced?

  I say yes

  Otherwise there is no improvement

  sharing new language requires communication - interplay - idea movement - idea enrichment

How should a group share knowledge?

  Requirement - narrow statements

  Strategy for achieving narrow statements

    Pre-shared agenda of topics - "is this something you care about?"

    Each topic is introduced by someone

    Then there are questions / criticisms.
