#+TITLE: 10X fanout

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Opinion: for abstraction to make sense, you need 10X fanout.

One tool, ten usages.

If you don't have ten usages, you shouldn't abstract.
Your architecture becomes too deep.

*how this piece is wrong*.
10X is /very precise/, but "abstraction" is vague.
Is adding a name abstraction?
Is extract to function abstraction?
Is extract to library abstraction?
I'd say "extract to library" is /more abstraction/ than "adding a name".
And having a reasonably high fanout / degree of reuse only makes sense when there is a certain degree of abstraction.
In other words, fanout factor and "abstractness" is both on a scale, and are coupled.
