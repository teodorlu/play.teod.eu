** I want to learn Zig
Why:

1. I want to tackle low-level stuff that [[id:6f1d8319-90b8-4006-9508-ef912fcd939b][Clojure]] isn't well suited for, and I want more control than I get from [[id:1c80cee5-af85-45ca-9b54-47e297eaa4d9][Go (programming language)]].
2. I want a language I could make OpenGL stuff in.
3. [[id:052c1cdc-f2fe-4ba5-b319-d0394be1e184][I want to learn C]], but I don't want to get stuck in ancient tooling.
4. I want to work with a lightweight foundation.
