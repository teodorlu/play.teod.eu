<h1 class="title">Freedom To Explore the Network</h1>
</header>
<p><a href="..">..</a></p>
<p>At every step of the way, I can make a choice. Go left, go right.
What I will pay attention to. What I will prioritize.</p>
<p>Look left. Look right. Where is the excitement? Where is the
challenge? Where is the meaning? Where is the known, where is the
unknown?</p>
<p>But why? Why be free?</p>
<p>That’s a bad question! Also, it’s actually two questions. (1) Why be?
and (2) why be free rather than nonfree?</p>
<p>“Why be?” is <em>also</em> a bad question. It is not something we can
choose. We cannot choose to be. We are not given a choice to be or not
to be before we are made. We can choose to take our life. But the choice
“Why be?” is <em>not</em> a question of suicide.</p>
<p>The other question if better. “Why be free rather than nonfree?” We
can answer this question with agency, adventure and learning. To be
nonfree is to live without agency, to avoid adventure, and to avoid
learning. Let’s choose to be free.</p>
<p>That freedom <em>means something</em>. We exercise that freedom every
day, whether we believe we do or not. A single unit of freedom is a
choice. Yet, if freedom was to make <em>one choice</em>, life would be
boring. Choices compound and unlock new options.</p>
<p>That is the freedom to explore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Leisure is freedom, work is striving towards goals. The two work
together, both are needed. Without structured effort working towards
goals, we limit our capability. Without unstructured exploration of the
network, we never discover what our goals actually were.</p>
<p>Work and leisure are not good or bad. They are tools for us to shape
our life.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don’t like 8 hour workdays. “fill these 8 hours”. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>8 hours is too long for highly concentrated work. And too short for
roaming exploration. For me.</p>
<p>I tried cutting at six hours. More leisure after work helped. Yet, I
am in a culture, and I felt other people’s expectations weighing on
me.</p>
<p>I do realize I need both. All leisure is not good. But what is the
balance? I need balance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is it all about goals and values? What do we aim to achieve? No.
Goals are one parts. Needs and capability is another. And those
intertwine with communication. What should we be doing? What are we able
to do? What are we motivated to do? They connect. Perhaps a start is to
define high-level categories. Each category has a different shape of
work. Make it explicit.</p>
<p>In <a href="../unicad/">Unicad</a>, we currently have three major
goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Land expert engineering projects where we can take a part, produce
something extraordinary, learn from the experience, and make some
money.</li>
<li>Grow number of parametric design users.</li>
<li>Grow number of calculation documentation users.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could take the three, and split along goals, capability and
motivation. Divide those into activities. Gain some sanity.</p>
<p>Then dedicate 3-4 hours each day to narrow work towards one of those
goals. For the rest, allow roaming.</p>
<p>Decication and focus is valuable, and important. Always looking for
the next new thing lets us see what others don’t notice, without doubt.
But that effort spent looking in all directions at all times has a cost.
By always looking for new things of strategic importance, we fail to
execute the obvious right in front of us.</p>
<hr />
<p>I had a delightful balance between work and leisure two weeks I spent
in Spain with friends while writing my master’s thesis<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
For 3-4 hours every morning, I worked on the thesis. Other than that, we
roamed around.</p>
<p>The <em>shape</em> of the thesis work was given. Deliver this text.
Will the shape of this so called “structured work” fit? Not
necessarily.</p>
<p>Possible courses of action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set aside 3 hours each morning for <em>individual work</em>.
Collaboration after lunch.</li>
<li>Define high-level goals, and actions working towards those goals.
Purpose: with defined goals and defined actions towards those goals, we
make the work explicit.</li>
<li>Limit total workday to 6 hours.</li>
<li>Introduce kanban-like system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps this is a matter of setting expectations. I will never spend
100 % of my time on execution. That is not for me. I will continue to
explore. And in the event of having to do execution-heavy work, I will
interperse that work with light exploratory work. I do this out of self
respect.</p>
