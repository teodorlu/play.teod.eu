;; # Hypermedia-driven interfaces in Babashka
;;
;; Still feeling a sliver of inspiration from Asbj√∏rn Ulsberg's talk [Hypermedia: The First 2000 Years] on Javazone 2025, I decided to put some lessons to use.
;; I have this little [Babashka-powered slideshow viewer] I like to use when I want the simplest possible basis for a presentation.
;; What if I just built support for editing and reordering slides straight into the viewer?
