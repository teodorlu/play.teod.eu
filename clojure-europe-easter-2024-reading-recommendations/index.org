I often get to spend some time reading in my easter holiday (after cross country skiing, an activity we sometimes do in Norway).
I could have picked the next unread title on my Kindle.
But ... how do I know that title is worth reading?

I don't trust the recommendations I get from Amazon.
Those are always similar to things I've read.
But I don't want to optimize for "looks the most like something I've read".
I want something /good/ that suits me, to an extent.

To solve for this, I asked for reading recommendations.
And I got so much more than I asked for.
So I figured I'd collect the responses, put them into tables, and give those tables an URL.
You're currently reading that URL!

As a final note, I believe curation is valuable, and I believe curation should be done by humans.
Ben Sless, Denis McCarty, Jack Rusher, Mario Tross and Matthias, thanks a lot for the recommendations!

Without further ado, here are the recommendations:
