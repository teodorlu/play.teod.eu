#+TITLE: Discovery, Power, Asymmetry

[[file:..][..]]

I believe in distributing and reifying intent.
Yet, during discovery there are asymmetries in experience, intent and context.
People are not equal.

Then what?

Oh, I think I know.

1. Treat people fairly
2. Don't assume people know, build shared understanding
3. Say no when required.

Perhaps it's that easy :)

I expected this to be hard to impossible.
But respect for the self, the work and others seems to just ... solve it?

Also, don't get mad.
Getting mad doesn't help.
