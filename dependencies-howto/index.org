#+TITLE: Dependencies: HOWTO

[[file:..][..]]

I used to believe that software architecture is about create big systems.
I no longer do that.

Now, I first think about objectives.
What user behaviors are we planning to support?
Do we understand the user problems we are solving?

Then, I think about dependencies.

1. Can we solve those with zero code?
2. Otherwise, can we solve those with one page of code and zero dependencies?
3. If not, can we solve those with one and limited, explicit, well-named dependencies?

If we do not think we can achieve our goals with either of the three options, I'm inclined to treat the code we write as exploration.
