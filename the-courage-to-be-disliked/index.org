#+begin_quote
If one really has a feeling of contribution, one will no longer have any need for recognition from others.
Because one will already have the real awareness that “I am of use to someone,” without needing to go out of one’s way to be acknowledged by others.
In other words, a person who is obsessed with the desire for recognition does not have any community feeling yet, and has not managed to engage in self-acceptance, confidence in others, or contribution to others.
