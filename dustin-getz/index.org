#+begin_quote
Intuition is the antonym of reason
#+end_quote

Agreed.
But I wonder whether those terms are meant to be value-laden.

Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is just an opinion
#+end_quote

Oooooh.

(Interlude - I feel myself /actively trying/ to find holes right now.
Not out of malice, but out of curiosity and ambition)

Though if we substitute "numbers" for "objectively falsifiable theory and observation", I'm inclined to agree.
