I've come to despise the creation of stress when stress is not required.

I realize that this is context dependent.
A real pursuit towards zero stress requires extraordinary levels of trust, shared vision and shared sense of quality.

I digress.

Trees don't induce stress.
They just are.
Frankly, they remove stress.
For me, at least.

So, I want that.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to meet great designers around my lunch table.
