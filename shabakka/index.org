#+title: Shabakka

[[./..][..]]

Idea - an intermediate representation as a bridge between babashka and bash

Functionality

1. Load bash script into IR
2. Load babashka script into IR
3. Write IR to bash script
4. Write IR to babashka script

Motivation

Ease migration from bash to babashka.

Strategy

Middle-out -- support a small subset of bash and babashka (starting out)

When hitting something we don't support native translation for, shell out to either babashka or bash.
