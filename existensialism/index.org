#+TITLE: Existentialism as a world view

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

I think the existentialists are the ones I agree the most with.
Yet, I don't really know what I'm talking about.

So here are some questions I'd like to answer:

1. What did the OGs of existentialism intend?
   1. What did they care about?
2. How do modern philosophy text books define existentialism?
