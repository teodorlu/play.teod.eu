#+TITLE: Downfall?: blinding perception and killing rebirth, a programmer's tale

[[file:..][..]]

You and I don't live in a dead world.
But life does not grow on its own.
You and I must play our part.

"perception and rebirth"

** Two conceptions of evil

Domination

Breaking trust

** Nihilist automatons

** Denying evil

** To perceive culture in pursuit of revitalization

** Build trust and create meaning
