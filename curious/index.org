#+TITLE: Please talk to me about stuff that doesn't fit!

[[file:..][..]]

I invite you to share weird ideas, funny experiences or things that don't fit ðŸ˜Š

I'm a curious person.
In general, I feel more "stuck" than in "free fall".
This has taken me a while to realize.
I thought I liked structure.
I still do, actually.
But that structure must be useful!
Come to think of it, I wrote about this in [[id:c62978a1-8081-4d44-9af4-93327f387085][Static-dynamic interaction]].

At work, this means I'm very much interested in digging into adjacent domains.
I treasure chances to learn something completely new.
I also weirdly like the hard conversation where we lack shared language.

So --- please --- talk to me about stuff that doesn't fit :)
