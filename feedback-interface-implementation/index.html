<p>State — DRAFT, but ready for feedback. Some sections feel incomplete,
and there’s no conclusion.</p>
<p>As software developers, we make decisions all day. How do I approach
this problem? How do I start carving off its unknown pieces? How can I
know where to direct my attention?</p>
<p>I’ve found that most of my effort as a software developer can be
reduced to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designing, creating and using feedback loops</li>
<li>Designing interfaces</li>
<li>Discovering how stuff works.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative title: <em>Multiscale design</em>. Why? We’re really just
making design explicit through the stack. Is that a better title? I
don’t really think so. It’s a bit vague.</p>
<p>Curious? Read on.</p>
<h2
id="motivation---my-go-to-mental-model-for-software-development">Motivation
- my go-to mental model for software development</h2>
<p>The most important thing I’ve learned about software development in
the last three years is to take feedback loops and interface design
seriously. I feel like I unlocked something. I don’t get stuck the same
way I used to get stuck. Thinking back, I used to throw brainpower at a
problem. Thinking that thinking would solve all the problems. A common
failure mode of mine was getting stuck in my head when the problem was
too big to fit.</p>
<p>That can simply happen when all there is is implementation. There’s
nothing else.</p>
<p>What can we do differently?</p>
<ul>
<li>We can see better</li>
<li>We can see smaller pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>We achieve seeing better by improving our feedback loop. We reduce
the problem to smaller pieces by designing interfaces.</p>
<p>“Then, should I focus on feedback, interface or implementation right
now?”</p>
<p>That’s a matter of taste!</p>
<p>But thinking about it, I definitely have a preference.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any feedback loop, make sure you have a feedback
loop. If your feedback loop sucks (&gt;1 second), fix it. (or at least
try, working without a good feedback loop sucks)</p>
<p>Depending on your environment, that feedback loop could run tests,
print stuff or whether your types line up. You should be able to
introduce an error, watch your feedback loop “go red”, fix the error and
go back to green.</p>
<p>Now that you have a feedback loop up and running, good! Interface
comes next. We’re trying to achieve something. For now, let’s only
consider the <em>what</em>. Anything we can do to ignore the
<em>how</em> is good. In typed programming languages, let’s consider
types. Are we transforming something? From a type to another? What are
those types? Do we need to write some types? I often like to write the
types of functions before I even name the function.</p>
<p>In data-oriented languages, we’ll want to consider some example data.
What are we transforming to what?</p>
<p>And in any case, we’ll probably want to use unit tests. The unit
tests are going to describe what’s <em>actually</em> going to happen.
While we can peek at some data, the unit tests don’t require peeking at
all. They have correct/incorrect encoded into the core. That means the
computer can help us find out which part of the system is failing. So we
prefer unit tests over eyeballing and examples.</p>
<p>In all these cases, we want to take our interface design (be it
interfaces or data models or tests) very seriously. We can completely
avoid big chunks of problems by picking the right type or data model.
“How seriously, in time?” Depends 😬 But perhaps 1/3 feedback system,
1/3 interface design and 1/3 implementation? Please don’t take this as
dogma. Try to feel your way forward. Experiment. Note that we don’t
spend the first hour on feedback, the next on interface and the third on
implementation! We jump back and forth.</p>
<p>Finally! We have our feedback loop. We can ask it “does it work now?”
(feedback) And we have defined what “correct” means (interface design)
Now, get cracking! Walk a step forwards, see the unit tests go green.
Celebrate! 🎉</p>

<h3 id="software-feedback-is-it-working-now">Software feedback — is it
working now?</h3>
<p>You’re going to do the work. But what do your increments look like?
How do you know that an increment works? Letting you know whether / how
your increments work is the job of your feedback loop. You’re going to
be checking your feedback loop frequently as you work. I prefer <em>very
often</em>. Every ten seconds of more often. Probably bound to some
on-save action.</p>
<h3
id="software-interface-design-the-thing-youre-making-how-is-it-used">Software
interface design — the thing you’re making, how is it used?</h3>
<p>The thing you’re making. How is it going to be used? What do you
provide? A module with a public interface? A REST endpoint? Will your
thing be <em>nice</em> to use?</p>
<p>When you’re working on interface design, it’s your job to ensure that
the things you’re making are nice to use.</p>
<h3 id="software-implementation-now-lets-make-it-work.">Software
implementation — now, let’s make it work.</h3>
<p>With a good feedback loop and solid interface design, implementation
is often the easy part. A good feedback loop lets you know whether / how
your thing works at every point in time. And good interface design will
split your problem into reasonable parts. If implementation is hard,
consider splitting your problem. Splitting your problem <em>is</em>
introducing an interface. So do a bit of interface design, then come
back. And ensure that your interface is easy to test — this means you’ll
get value out of your feedback loop!</p>

<p>How long is the cycle time from changing product behavior to seeing
how the new behavior performs? How <em>wide</em> is the product feedback

done with your product than with options? What are the best jobs to be
done?</p>

<li>hard changes — primary structure — don’t destroy existing

<p>Finally, the top level. Let’s recap.</p>
<p>Level 1 - software view. The interface is the <em>module
interface</em>. Feedback is how easy it is to work with modules.</p>
<p>Level 2 - product view. The interface is the <em>product
texture</em>. Feedback is how smooth it is to execute a workflow.</p>
<p>Makes sense? Now, let’s introduce the birds-eye view.</p>
<p>Level 3 - industry view. The interface is current market best
practices. Feedback is how effectively the workflows can compete with
other workflows. Are you enabling better workflows?</p>

<p>The article is over!</p>
<h3 id="retrospective-on-this-article">Retrospective on this
article</h3>
<p>Right now, I’ve split the article into sections about feedback loop,
interface design and implementation. That’s clear. However, the lines
get kinda … blurred sometimes. Take the trailing part of the section
about implementation in software development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a good feedback loop and solid interface design, implementation
is often the easy part. A good feedback loop lets you know whether / how
your thing works at every point in time. And good interface design will
split your problem into reasonable parts. If implementation is hard,
consider splitting your problem. Splitting your problem <em>is</em>
introducing an interface. So do a bit of interface design, then come
back. And ensure that your interface is easy to test — this means you’ll
get value out of your feedback loop!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would it be better to separate between definitions (what
feedback/interface/implementation means in a context) and case-based
discussion? 🤔</p>
<h4 id="potential-case-studies">Potential case studies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Developing a software module: ?
<ul>
<li>Example – my live documentation for Amedia.
<ul>
<li>Feedback loop is simply <code
class="verbatim">npx live-server</code></li>
<li>Module design: pure functions + a react component</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Developing a user-facing feature: ?
<ul>
<li>Example – my live documentation for Amedia.
<ul>
<li>Feedback loop – does the docs explain its use case with sufficient
detail to real user?</li>
<li>Interface design – Does the user understand the problem the
documentation solves? Is the input field labeling good? Is it clear to
the user how the generated output should be consumed? Is the generated
output good?</li>
</ul></li>

<p>it’s tighter. and interface/internals is a stronger contrast than
“interface design” and “how stuff works”.</p>
<p>also, “interface design” – the feedback loop must be desinged, the
internals must be designed. also, “how stuff works” is super vague and
should be avoided.</p>
