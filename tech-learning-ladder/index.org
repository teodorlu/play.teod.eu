#+TITLE: tech learning ladder

[[file:..][..]]

Timestamp: 2023-05-01

As a tech person, what might one learn?

I find that to be a hard question.
Our industry is moving.
Our tools are changing.
And as we get better, we gain agility.
We don't slow down, we speed up.

So I'm hesitant to leave this document as /the answer for forever/.
I'll strive for [[id:dfd45cfa-3154-47ef-8f74-06fe0e69715e][lindy compatibility]] where possible, but not at the expense of clarity.

Here we go.
In Norwegian.
I'm sorry.

- HTTP og servere
- Testing og andre teknikker for å vite om koden gjør den du tror den gjør
- Utviklingsprosess.
  Parprogrammering, mob-programmering, PR-er, feature-flagging, gradvis utrulling
- Databaser og datamodellering
- CSS
- React
- Sikkerhet

That's all for level 1.
Topics that can be postponed are put below the "fold" (the horizontal line)
