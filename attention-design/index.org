#+TITLE: attention design

[[./..][..]]

Do: consider thoroughly where you point your attention.

*My process for personal attention design is note taking.*

Copied from [[id:bd776ab0-d687-4f16-b66d-d03c86de2a2e][My public journal]] at 2022-07-14:

*named ideas* have a deeper meaning.
They have an URL, and can be linked to.

*project journal* is temporally indexed.
Date up top, topic below.
Project-scope rambling.

*project problems* is a mutable approach to attention design.
It does /not/ function as a ledger.
Rather, it is meant to be changed.
Problem-scope attention design.

*journal* is the temporally indexed global catch-all thing.
Put things here when in doubt.
Global-scope rambling.

*problems* is a global list of things that want attention.
Global scope attention design.

*I consider organizational attention design to be a rich, open problem.*
