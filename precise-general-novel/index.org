#+title: Precise, general, novel

[[./..][..]]

Three axes:

| vague      | precise |
| specific   | general |
| well-known | novel   |

Forms a 3D space.

Pysics: precise, general, well-known.

My engineering experience: precise, quite specific, novel.

Web3 wild speculation: vague, general, novel.

Idea --- always better to move to the right.
But hard.

* 2D version -- precision and generality
* My friction -- want to move right.
I often accept a small loss of precision to gain generality.
Others are often happy with me when I strive to be specific.
