Your Build Step is a Leopard

[Douglas Adams Quote]

The fear of the leopard inhibits your movement.
It directly reduces your agility.
Therefore, when not required, it's bad!

# Simplicity as abscence of suprise / Simplicity as abscense of leopards

Surprising requirements: this first, then that
Why?

Do this, otherwise other thing won't work.
Why??

Oh, this can only be executed in the context of PLACE
Why???

Oh, and now you're in the wrong build step.
The princess generation is in the meta-build-step!
Why????

For my love of Douglas Adams and Franz Kafka, why do we inflict this upon ourselves?

As Kafka suggests, it is not out of malice.
It is accidental.
And it is our job as software designers to *not* [let the code rot].
Instead, we must reify and improve the explanations of our code.
