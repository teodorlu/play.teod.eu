#+TITLE: Practice deliberately with journals

[[file:..][..]]

Something happened.
I started to /write/ as a way to think.
I haven't fully grasped the consequences of that event.

To get good, learning is essential.
We learn through practice.
What is practice?

.

My process now:

1. Curate a list of interesting problems.
   Each problem is something I want to learn about.
2. For each problem, create a problem journal.
3. Then, when I'm curious, pick a problem journal at random.

There.
That's it.
