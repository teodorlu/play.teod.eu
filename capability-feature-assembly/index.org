* Product development
*Capability*.
Skill / knowledge we have.
No cost.
Enables options.

*Feature*.
Thing a user can do.

*Assembly*.
Hmm, this doesn't really fit.
Perhaps there's only ... or is this job to be done? "Assemble a bunch of features into a workflow"
* Capability, feature, workflow
Capabilities compose into a feature.

Features compose into a workflow.

A workflow provides net value for the product user.
