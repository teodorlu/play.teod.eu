#+title: Aphorisms

[[./..][..]]

1 - Fewer moving pieces is better.
Corollary: unnecessary flexibility is bad.

2 - (stronger) - More than minimum number of moving pieces is bad.

3 - DO care about intent.
In code, outside of code.

4 - Late binding is awesome.

5 - Never link to content without enriching the intent of linking with context.

6 - Consider modeling /all possible states/ as one data structure.
Fewer edge cases are easier to manage.

7 - DO - critique your documentation when "How does X work?" is asked.

8 - DON'T require hierarchy to be equal to legibility.

9 - Emacs is a tool for research, and happens to also work for editing source code.

10 - When in doubt, do that which builds trust.

11 - When still in doubt, do that which reifies and distributes intent.

12 - When /still/ in doubt, reduce WIP.

13 - When /STILL/ in doubt, improve your specific & general feedback loops.
