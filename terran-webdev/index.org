#+TITLE: Terran webdev: grounded tools for interactive web

[[file:..][..]]

Keep it simple while you can.
Complexity will catch up sooner or later.

Today, we will explore keeping deployment simple (just files), while also keeping dev simple (just evaluation).

Do less.
Gain speed, loose drag.

This directory contains a text file and a generated index.html.
Deployment is an index.html copy.
Development is not just evaluation.
Let's make that happen.

How to notify on reload?
Ideas:

- 5 px bottom bar that animates from heavy green to translucent, then disappears.
  Ideally: a moving radial-blurred "ball".
