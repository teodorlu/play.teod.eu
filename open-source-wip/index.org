* TODO Neil: maintain alphabetical ordering of deps

I [[https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C03KCV7TM6F/p1712056116950329][asked for this]]:

#+begin_quote
Personally, I like to keep my :deps in sorted order. One possible way of doing it, is:

1. Check of existing deps is in sorted order (for example with rewrite-edn)
2. if yes, add the new dep into the sorted order instead of at the end.

Is that something youâ€™d like to add to Neil?

There's already an issue:
