#+TITLE: Less stuff

[[file:..][..]]

I wonder if we might be drastically better off with less stuff.

Make less stuff.
Spend less time making stuff.
Spend more time setting direction before starting to make more stuff.
Slow down.

The best counter argument I can come up with is that the act of making stuff is a skill, and as a skill it needs to be exercised.
You won't become a master without putting in your practice hours.

Perhaps this is the heart of the problem.
Who ever sells the output of their practice?

Perhaps separating the two would be good.
Practice intensely, get good.
Discard the practice artifacts.

Then, when it counts, do real, productive quality work.
Less finalized stuff—but many more practice sessions.
