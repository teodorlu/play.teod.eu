<h2 id="welcome-knowledge-worker-1">Welcome, knowledge worker!</h2>
<p>I hope you’ll have an amazing time, do amazing work and meet amazing
people.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in agile movement on a solid foundation. In an
ideal world, I see people moving freely. The static boosts the movement
of the dynamic.</p>
<p>It is not my place to direct your movement. But I’d like to help
point your attention to the things that do not move.</p>
<p>I’d like to help you get started with your foundation.</p>
<h2 id="topics-trust-value-and-software">Topics: trust, value and
software</h2>
<p>I’m going to suggest you read three books:</p>
<ol>
<li>a book on how to build trust,</li>
<li>a book on how to provide value to others,</li>
<li>and a book on how to build software.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why trust, value and software, exactly?</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>thing</th>
<th>why</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>trust</td>
<td>because relationships founded on trust is how you make things happen
in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>value</td>
<td>because knowing what value you provide empowers and frees you.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>software</td>
<td>because there are old people whose techniques you should steal.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When you understand trust, value and software deeply, it’s going to
be easier for you to move forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh you want to learn D3.js? You already have some foundational
understanding of software. And you know how to judge the value you
provide by building something with D3. And you have people around you
that you can ask for feedback and share your work with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short: understanding trust, value and software is a force
multiplier for other things you want to learn and do.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="trust">Trust</h2>
<p>All your relationships with other people are characterized by trust.
You trust your closest friends. Trust makes all other things easy. You
don’t have to start from scratch each time. It’s easy to work together.
It’s easy to communicate.</p>
<p>In certain organizations, trust is substituted for domination. You
have to do what your boss says.</p>
<p>Actually, I lied. Trust is a scale. I can promise you that your
domineering manager has <em>some</em> people he trusts more than others.
Who might that be? Watch him. When does he listen intently? To whom does
he ask questions? Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Trust isn’t objective. Trust is deeply subjective. And it starts low,
depending on how you met a person. Through friends, perhaps. Perhaps as
a phone call reportedly about a problem with your computer.</p>
<p>But. <em>You can build trust.</em> You can give the people around you
a reason to trust you. You can choose to listen, and choose to help.</p>
<p><a href="../jocko-willink/">Jocko Willink</a> crisply describes what
you can do right now to build trust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your boss isn’t making a decision in a timely manner or providing
necessary support for you and your team, don’t blame the boss. First,
blame yourself. Examine what you can do to better convey the critical
information for decisions to be made and support allocated.</p>
<p>Leading up the chain of command requires tactful engagement with the
immediate boss (or in military terms, higher headquarters) to obtain the
decisions and support necessary to enable your team to accomplish its
mission and ultimately win. To do this, a leader must push situational
awareness up the chain of command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can build relationships of trust to the people around you,
you’ll have an easy time getting help and feedback.</p>
<p>I recommend reading <a href="../extreme-ownership/">Extreme
Ownership</a> by <a href="../jocko-willink/">Jocko Willink</a> to learn
how to build trust. Start with <em>Chapter 10: Leading Up and Down the
Chain of Command</em> if you’re in a hurry.</p>
<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<p>I recommend reading <a href="../empowered/">Empowered</a> by <a
href="../marty-cagan/">Marty Cagan</a> to understand how you can judge
your impact. The thing you made, does it help people? Was it worthwhile
to build?</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I recommend reading <a href="../the-art-of-unix-programming/">The Art
of Unix Programming</a> by <a href="../eric-raymond/">Eric Raymond</a>
to understand your options for creating software. How are others going
to interact with the thing you made?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="appendix-a-journaling">Appendix A: journaling</h2>
<p>When in doubt, ask yourself “what’s important?” and start
writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you asking the right question?</li>
<li>If it’s hard, try slicing it up.</li>
<li>If you dare, share what you learn with your peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use journaling all the time when I want to learn something. If you
want an example, check out <a href="../emacs/">(Doom) Emacs learning
journal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-b-more-books">Appendix B: more books</h2>
<p>You can safely skip these. At least for now. Learning is hard enough
as it is. Learning lots of different stuff at the same time is even
harder. So, please give yourself some breathing room. Please!</p>
<p>Still adamant? OK, please go ahead.</p>

href="../the-courage-to-be-disliked/">The Courage to Be
Disliked</a>.</p>
<p>more on value: <a href="../the-beginning-of-infinity/">The Beginning
of Infinity</a>, by David Deutsch. Why: it crisply defines what’s useful
to do in science. Note: this is a tough read, don’t beat yourself up if
you think it’s hard.</p>
<p>more on programming: <a href="../the-pragmatic-programmer/">The
Pragmatic Programmer</a>, second edition. By Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt.
Why: great read, actionable, will make your code better.</p>
<p>more on programming 2: <a href="../grokking-simplicity/">Grokking
Simplicity</a> by Eric Normand. Why: it introduces functional
programming by focusing on what FP lets you <em>do</em> rather than
attempt to stuff abstract theory down your throat.</p>
