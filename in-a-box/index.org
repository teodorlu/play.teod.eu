They are born, then put in a box;
they go home to live in a box;
they study by ticking boxes;
they go to what is called "work" in a box;
where they sit in their cubicle box;
they drive to the grocery store in a box to buy food in a box;
they go to the gym in a box to sit in a box;
they talk about thinking "outside the box";
and when they die they are put in a box.
All boxes, Euclidian, geometrically smooth boxes.
