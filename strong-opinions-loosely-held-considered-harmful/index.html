<h2 id="73c043">Part 1 ‚Äì a taxonomy of knowledge.</h2>
<p>‚ÄúStrong opinions‚Äù is an excuse for imprecise, sloppy thinking. Sloppy
thinking is bad. Don‚Äôt do it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? I think so. First, I propose a taxonomy of
knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge
<ul>
<li>Fact
<ul>
<li>Observation</li>
<li>Implication</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Judgement
<ul>
<li>Aphorism</li>
<li>Contextual utility</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>An observation is a record in time.</em> Observations are facts.
‚ÄúOn 2022-12-17, I saw a user struggle to understand how to navigate an
app I made‚Äù is an observation.</p>
<p><em>An implication connects cause and relation".</em> Implications
are facts. ‚ÄúIf we separate between mutable code and immutable code, we
derive a clean caching strategy for the immutable code‚Äù is an
implications. Another example is ‚ÄúWhen the user gets a login error,
there‚Äôs a fault in the system John is making‚Äù.</p>
<p>Facts can be invalidated. We can misremember events, or use sloppy
logic. Facts are true or false, not good or bad.</p>
<p>In contrast, judgment is subjective. You can ask people for
information, for facts. You can also ask people for help judging
something. Here are three examples:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>observation</td>
<td>Mark practically knows Go‚Äôs standard library by heart, he was able
to point me to <a
href="https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Split">strings.Split()</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>implication</td>
<td>Last Tuesday, Ben helped me figure out why code crashed when I was
stuck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>judgment</td>
<td>I asked Ann how I should approach working with a customer, and she
helped me understand their point of view.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I split judgment into aphorism and contextual utility.</p>
<p><em>An aphorism is a deeply held belief</em>. It‚Äôs part of your
theory of the world. ‚ÄúDo: treat people with respect‚Äù is an aphorism.
Your aphorisms are shaped by your experience. Treating the people you
meet with respect is good for long term relationships, but it might
cause you harm in low trust environments. It would be nice to just be
perfect. I‚Äôm not. You‚Äôre probably not either. We humans are. We can‚Äôt
rewrite our past, we must live with it. I believe we should accept that
we hold deep beliefs which cannot be changed on a whim.</p>
<p><em>Contextual utility is when you recognize a good thing to do in a
situation.</em> You‚Äôre able to recognize and match some situation to
potential actions, and pick one that makes sense. You ask a good follow
up question because you recognize the situation of your conversation
partner, have a hunch of where to move the conversation, and are able to
open up something that was previously fuzzy and unknown.</p>
<center>
!
</center>

<p>Phew. That was a lot. We‚Äôve got a bit further to go, please bear with
me. I promise that there‚Äôs a specific call to action at the end!</p>
<center>
üò∫
</center>

<h2 id="71e9ee">Part 2 ‚Äì so what?</h2>
<p>By talking more precisely about knowledge, we can build better stuff
together. So, where does ‚Äúbetter‚Äù fit into this hierarchy of knowledge?
Where‚Äôs the quality? That‚Äôs a great question, and I don‚Äôt have a precise
answer. I believe quality is both objective and subjective. It doesn‚Äôt
fit neatly into either of the four categories. Rather, it ties fact and
judgment together.</p>
<p>So, what should we do?</p>
<p>I started out claiming that ‚ÄúStrong opinions loosely held‚Äù is an
excuse for sloppy thinking. A strong opinion stands on its own, as a
whole. It is in part observation, in part implication, in part aphorism
and in part contextual utility. A big, monolithic opinion is hard to
criticize precisely. You either agree with it, or you don‚Äôt. When you‚Äôre
choosing to hold strong opinions, you put the burden of total analysis
on your conversational partner. I think that‚Äôs a bad thing to do. And
you can choose to <em>not do it</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, hold and present <em>narrow opinions</em>. Avoid depending
on your aphorisms when possible. When expressing contextual utility,
make the context explicit. Explain the situation in which you‚Äôre
suggesting your cause of action. Complex problems tend to require
observations, implications and contextual utility. Don‚Äôt lump these
together. Split them. By sharing your observations, others can trust
your perception, or present conflicting evidence. Your implications can
help others learn how you reason. When you‚Äôve split up and recomposed
your problem, end by asking questions to shape the conversation. Help
people help you by sharing where you‚Äôre uncertain. Are you missing
information? Is there a part of your suggested course of action you‚Äôre
not confident about? How can other people help you? Ask about that. Then
people can understand where you‚Äôre coming from, and how they can help
you.</p>
<p><em>How about you? You‚Äôre just perfectly doing this all the
time?</em> Not at all. This is an ideal! Precise thinking requires more
effort.</p>
<h2 id="7f5c12">Part 3 ‚Äì write shit down.</h2>
<p>If you don‚Äôt make your thinking explicit, you won‚Äôt be able to look
at your thinking from the outside. Explicit thinking is exactly what you
get when you write down what you think. You disconnect from the ‚Äúreact
to what‚Äôs happening right now‚Äù loop. You can revisit your thoughts at a
later point in time, and see if you still believe what you wrote.</p>
<p>Let compassion for others motivate you when you write. Who is your
target audience? How can you make it easy for them? Take your time to
disassemble your ball of ideas before you attempt to shove it into
another person‚Äôs head. Or be precise in what you‚Äôre asking for. ‚ÄúYou
should do as I say‚Äù is a very different thing to ask for than ‚ÄúCan you
help me disentangle this problem I can‚Äôt get my head around?‚Äù</p>
<p>Writing is caring.</p>

<h4 id="db23f">The jump from ‚Äúsloppy thinking‚Äù to ‚Äúa taxonomy of

<p>I start out like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúStrong opinions‚Äù is an excuse for imprecise, sloppy thinking. Sloppy
thinking is bad. Don‚Äôt do it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? I think so. First, I propose a taxonomy of
knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge

<li>Contextual utility</li>

<p>The jump from sloppy thinking to a taxonomy of knowledge strikes me
as sudden and surprising. Suggestions for improvement are much welcome.
I especially dislike the ‚ÄúIs there an alternative? I think so. First, I
propose a taxonomy of knowledge‚Äù part.</p>

<h4 id="D-f863f">Where does ‚ÄúStrong opinions, weakly held‚Äù come
from?</h4>
<p>I found a text by Bob Sutton written in 2006: <a
href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html">https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html</a></p>
<p>And a 2014 tweet by Adam Grant referencing Bob Sutton: <a
href="https://twitter.com/adammgrant/status/508601907330686976">https://twitter.com/adammgrant/status/508601907330686976</a></p>
<p>Thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I‚Äôve criticized the ghost of an idea, not the original
artifact.</li>
<li>When I read the original text, I see an argument for a strong vision
built on falsifiable hypotheses.
<ol>
<li>Similar to my options from <a href="../oggpow/">OGGPOW: A strategic
framework for optionality</a>, and <a href="../anders-haugeto/">Anders
Haugeto</a>‚Äôs ‚Äúbets‚Äù.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I really like the original text.</li>
</ol>
<p>I‚Äôd like to suggest a better title for the ‚ÄúStrong opinions weakly
held‚Äù concept:</p>
<p><em>Clear opinions supported by falsifiable evidence</em>. I wonder
if <a href="../david-deutsch/">David Deutsch</a> would find that
acceptable?</p>

<h4 id="perhaps-i-should-restructure-the-whole-text">Perhaps I should

<p>How about</p>
