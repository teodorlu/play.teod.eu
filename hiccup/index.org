A way to work with HTML as pure Clojure data.

#+begin_src clojure
[:ul [:li "apples"] [:li "oranges"]]
#+end_src

turns into

#+begin_src html
<ul><li>apples</li><li>oranges</li></ul>
#+end_src

in HTML.

Hiccup lets us work with HTML as data.
Data is easier to manipulate than strings or external mutable state.
