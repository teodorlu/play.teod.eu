<p>Don’t hesitate, put that rage on Twitter! But don’t stop there.
Create a mob! Start a movement! Protest against the government, find
somebody to blame!</p>

<p>Or?</p>
<p>It appears that subjective experience and objective reality is not
exactly the same thing. Subjective experiences are real, but real in the
sense that the feeling is real, not in the sense that the opinions that
follow the feeling are objectively true.</p>
<p>To disambiguate between the subjective and the objective, I’d like to
defer to <a href="../david-deutsch/">David Deutsch</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If beauty is objective, why is there so much variation in
what people consider beautiful?</strong></p>
<p>Beauty has both a subjective and objective part. Human aesthetic
judgment is a complicated mixture of genetic, cultural and objective
factors. If you look at paintings from centuries ago, you will find that
the women tend to be considerably heavier than what we now consider to
be ideal. That can be neither objective nor genetic, so it must be
cultural. Our preference for symmetry is probably related to our
preference for healthy mates — many diseases and deformities make people
less symmetrical. So that one could be genetic.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the nature of objective beauty is still primitive.
We cannot reliably distinguish between subjective and objective beauty,
certainly not by just looking. Things that meet aesthetic preferences
built into our brains or instilled by culture look just as beautiful to
us as those that are objectively beautiful.</p>

<p>You may have encountered something objectively bad. Your rage may be
righteous, and exactly what is required to fuel your motivation to
create a better world.</p>
<p>Or you may have encountered something subjectively bad, due to a
difference of aesthetic preference. In that case, seeking understanding
might be more helpful than finding an outlet for your anger.</p>
<p>I’d like to argue that the statement “I don’t understand it,
therefore it’s bad” is bad from an epistemic point of view: it mixes up
the subjective with the objective. “I don’t understand it” describes
your subjective experience. “It’s bad” is an objective claim,
generalized broadly from your experience. What if the thing you’re
trying to learn is essentially hard, and requires real effort to
learn?</p>
<p>Consider splitting your understanding from the objective quality of
the thing. It’s perfectly fine to not understand things! Lean into that.
When you know you don’t understand something, that’s the first step to
understanding it. But don’t try to skip over the learning process. First
try to clarify what you’re not understanding. What are you trying to
achieve? What did you try to do to reach your goal? Then what
happened?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can ask someone to explain the thing you don’t
understand. My experience is that people are often happy to help you
learn new things. But beware of jumping to conclusions too quickly.
Expressing rage that the thing they made is bad might not help you reach
your goals.</p>
