#+TITLE: Bumblebee

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

This libary does not yet exist.

*Idea*: wrap the [[id:7b88332e-f8a7-452b-bfd8-d128728182ce][OpenFOAM]].
Aim for easy use with [[id:9799d27f-49d0-414a-bb94-f611588fc85c][Clerk]].
Provide a data language (avoid string manipulation), and convenience functions for showing fluid fields.

*Logo*: a determined bumblebee flying in strong headwind, with fluid flow lines showing turbulence and drag sources.
Consider asking Camilla if she's interested in helping draw something.
