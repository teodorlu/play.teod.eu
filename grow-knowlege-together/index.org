#+title: How to grow knowledge together

[[./..][..]]

Status: DRAFT

Short answer: not quite sure yet. But the solution involves creating and discussing ideas.

Why?

I believe curating knowledge together is possible.
If you had asked me about collectively building knowledge two years ago, I would have been skeptical.
What has changed?
Well, something.
But if /I/ as skeptical myself just two years ago, why would others just raise their hands up in the air and join?
Of course.
Do I blindly follow people who shout?
No.
What do I do?
I require intent.
Where is the intent?
Where is the intent!!!

How?

With bottom up knowledge synthesis!
