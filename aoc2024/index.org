#+TITLE: Age of Code 2024

[[file:..][..]]

I figured I wanted to participate in Advent of Code this year.
But I want to do it /my way/.
So, what's my way?

1. I want to solve days in Clojure with Clerk first.
2. Then I /maybe/ want to try solve the same task with Zig.
3. And I want to time how long time i spend on each.

*The timer*.
An EDN file should be all that's needed, right?
