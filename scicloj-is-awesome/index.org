#+TITLE: Scicloj is awesome

[[file:..][..]]

[[https://scicloj.github.io/][Scicloj]]
is a Clojure community for data science.
It's awesome!

* Scicloj is awesome because
1. There's a thorough [[https://scicloj.github.io/docs/resources/libs/][list of available Clojure tools and libraries]] you can leverage
2. There's plenty of [[https://scicloj.github.io/docs/resources/reading/][recommended reading]] you can work through on your own
3. It's easy to get help.

* What does the Clojure data science ecosystem need?
My opinion:

1. Learnability
2. Discoverability
3. Cohesion

Learnability comes first.
Someone must be able to /learn something/.

Discoverability second.
If there is nice stuff around but nobody can find it, there's not much value provided to the ecosystem as a whole.

Cohesion third.
Most people look to the Python ecosystem for data science.
Why?
Data science with Python is learnable and discoverable.
There are plenty of resources available.
Data science work with Python often leverages [[https://scipy.org/][SciPy]].
SciPy is also awesome.
SciPy provides a cohesive entrypoint to Python data science.

* Idea - sc-dbx
An experimental plaintext graph-oriented knowledge base for doing data science in Clojure.

1. Page oriented (like https://play.teod.eu)
* A specific place to start: a nice viewer for the library data
Aaaand we return to where we started: https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj.github.io/issues/58

*Good user interface to explore available libraries*
