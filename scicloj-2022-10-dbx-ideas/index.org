#+TITLE: Scicloj 2022-10: ideas for collective knowledge

[[file:..][..]]

url: https://play.teod.eu/

async questions later? ping me on #babashka on Clojurians Slack :)

* rationale
1. I'm interested in Scicloj and collective knowledge management
2. I'm excited about my current learning process
3. And I'm interested in helping others do the same.
* vision
scicloj knowledge archipelago
* demo: =play.teod.eu=
Things to (possibly) show:

1. New page to production.
2. Linking to other pages
3. the =play.clj relations= CLI

I'm going to emphasize "showing the whole" over "explaining how everything works".
* terminology
1. [[id:0c9bef25-85ef-48e8-b4fd-d60160f177ec][play.teod.eu]] --- my knowledge playground / backyard / garden
2. [[id:f4762ab2-c1e5-4b90-9e59-be3ad6e6eafd][dbx]] --- "a collective knowledge toolkit for babashka zealots"
   1. Very much WIP
   2. In its current state, won't help you with anything
   3. You're better off cloning teodorlu/play.teod.eu and exploring
* tech stack
(please jump in and ask questions if you want to see)

1. Lots of babashka
2. one folder for each document
   1. html in git - no build step
   2. metadata in EDN files
      1. CLI for modifying metadata
3. a generated makefile
   1. for dbx, I want pure babashka, no makefiles.

/Q: how can I learn Clojure data science?/

/Q: how do we create, collect and index Clojure data science learning materials together?/

Existing initiatives:

1. [[https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-cookbook][clojure-data-cookbook]]
2. [[https://github.com/clojupedia/clojupedia.org][clojupedia.org]]
