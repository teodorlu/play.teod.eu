#+TITLE: sterility, mess and utility

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Sterility impedes utility.
Mess impedes utility.

What are other words?

The purpose of order is utility.
The purpose of chaos is utility.
Essentially what I wanted to say in Static-Dynamic interaction (on teodorheggelund.com)

So ...

We want /the right structure/.
Finding the right structure is about laying an effective border between the moving parts and the parts that stand still.

Ways to nudge towards order:

1. Write things down
2. Establish habits
3. Establish protocols

Ways to nudge towards chaos:

1. Provide optionality
2. Give autonomy
