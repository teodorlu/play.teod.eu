#+TITLE: Enter the Forest at its Darkest Point

[[file:..][..]]

Why 1: because that's your maximal learning potential

Why 2: because it's uniquely /for you/.
Trails are made by others.
Only you can perceive this darkness.
For others, the darkest point will be elsewhere.

Application to software and product:
Attack the hardest problem first.
If you can't solve the hardest problem, you'll have to redo the whole thing.
In other words, aim towards the maximal unknownness.
