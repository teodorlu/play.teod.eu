#+TITLE: value in context

[[file:..][..]]

I believe value in context is the beginning of shared trust and shared sense of quality.
It's specific, it speaks for itself.

To build trust, provide value in context.
Build trust /first/.
That's the "charity" part of trust.
(The others are integrity and competence, according to [[https://masteroppgaver.app.iterate.no/andreas-friestad-h%C3%A5vard-opheim/][Trust Building on Digital Labour Platforms: the Workerâ€™s Perspective]]).
Charity is being willing to provide value in context /first/ - without expecting demonstration of value in context from others first.
