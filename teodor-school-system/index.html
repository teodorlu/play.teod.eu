<p>DRAFT</p>
<p>What+how should we teach kids?</p>
<p>That’s a problem I’d love the chance to work on at some point in my
life.</p>
<p>This document is highly subjective, and is likely to change. The
problem is hard, and has been worked on by smart people.</p>
<h2 id="section">2023-05-27</h2>
<h3 id="subjects">Subjects</h3>
<p>My best bet per 2023-05-27 is these four (in alphabetical order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetics.</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Then encourage activities that combine the subjects, for example
dance (movement and aesthetics) or system design (aesthetics and
analysis).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. Visuals, taste, food. History of
art.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>. Science, reason, logic, mathematics,
physics, machines.</li>
<li><strong>Literature</strong>. Writing, reading, communicating,
speaking. Theater.</li>
<li><strong>Movement</strong>. Dance, swimming, running, BJJ.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem: where is the adventure? Where is the movement into the
unknown? Perhaps that’s not a problem, perhaps that’s just a
combination. <em>Movement</em> into the unknown, in order to find
something <em>aeshetically</em> better. <em>Analysis</em> of whether
it’s better, <em>literature</em> about the journey.</p>
<p>Goal: living in a moldable system. This sort of combines all the
things. Don’t give kids ipads. Give kids something they can explore the
inner workings of. And something that encourages that exploration
<em>together</em>. (ie what Kay, Papert, et al seem to conclude)</p>
<p>Goal: encourage people that they can <em>change their circumstances
for the better</em>. Your environment is not static, it’s dynamic. Your
environment is meant to be lived in.</p>
<p>Goal: find joy in all four. Joy in aesthetics: “This feels
<em>right</em> to me”. Joy in analysis: “Playing around with this
machine is <em>fun</em>, it lets me see better, understand better”. Joy
in literature: “Man this story is engaging! I want to take part!” Joy in
movement: “I feel the flow!”</p>
<h3 id="otfrom-comments-where-is-expression">otfrom comments: Where is
“Expression”?</h3>
<p>From <a href="../clojurians-slack/">the Clojurians Slack</a> (<a
href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/CBJ5CGE0G/p1685180318899499">thread
link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you are missing “Expression” in your 4 overarching things. It
might be captured in your activities for the other four, but it would be
easy for it to be formulaic without having the ability to express what
you want as one of the goals/subjects.</p>
<p>Expression is why I do free writing 5 days per week and I find it
difficult to keep going, but rewarding when I do because the practice
makes it easier for me.</p>
<p>Though all of us here do a lot of expressing as building something in
code is a form of expression (regardless of what that thing is)</p>
<p>—otfrom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hmmm.</p>
<p>Is “expression” a way to “make it real”? Like practicing a real
instrument in order to play a song “for real” for someone at some point
in time?</p>
<p>I think you have a point.</p>
<p>When I look back at when I went to school, it seemed fake. Fake
history: read some years to present on a test. Fake English: read some
words to remember them for a test.</p>

<li><a href="../rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a> has touched on
“expression” in <a href="../design-composition-performance/">Design,
Composition and Performance</a> and “performance”</li>
<li>How should this schools system be funded?
<ul>
<li>Norwegian public schools have large classes (20 to 30 kids) and
tightly, centrally controlled curriculums.</li>
<li>Private schools cost a lot and amplify socio-economic
differences.</li>
<li>In bad schools, there are often no good teachers to set good
examples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expression is a way to use what you’ve learned to get a chance to
move beoyond it. Also, learning to express yourself in some way is
important. (<a

<ol>
<li>Free writing every day is a way to exercise expression (<a
href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/CBJ5CGE0G/p1685266145263599?thread_ts=1685180318.899499&amp;cid=CBJ5CGE0G">source</a>)</li>
<li>Prompts can be used to break free of writing the same thing every
day (<a
href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/CBJ5CGE0G/p1685266213307359?thread_ts=1685180318.899499&amp;cid=CBJ5CGE0G">source</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Creative expression typically requires constraints in order to avoid
the “tyranny of the blank canvas”</li>
<li>There’s tension between “education for workers” and “education for
thinkers” (<a
href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/CBJ5CGE0G/p1685266708417809?thread_ts=1685180318.899499&amp;cid=CBJ5CGE0G">source</a>)</li>
<li>Education
<ol>
<li>Teodor’s current understanding:
<ol>
<li>Western education is based on <em>skills</em> (techne), eastern
education is based on principles</li>
<li>Don’t feel like I have a grasp on eastern thinking. The western
approach sometimes feels “dead”.</li>
<li>Not sure how I should approach learning this. Perhaps living in it
is required, that even the question “is there a book I can read?” builds
in the (western) assumption that this can be learned from books. The
Beatles went to India. This cool Norwegian singer/songwriter I got the
chance to talk to went to India to train his vocals, and enjoyed the
experience.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>“The categories overlap in many interesting ways that are not clear
in their presentation here. Maybe a Venn-ish diagram would be better?
(Trivial example: dance is movement + aesthetics.)” (<a

<li>“A missing category here is emotional education. One of the most
important things we learn in the course of life is to cease to be a
slave to emotional impulses, while also remaining in touch with the
important things they tell us.” (<a
