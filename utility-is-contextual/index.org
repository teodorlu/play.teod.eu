#+TITLE: utility is contextual

[[file:..][..]]

To the best of my knowledge, "utility is contextual" is coined by [[id:cf51b512-3236-4c9d-befa-a477994123e0][Zach Tellman]].

Premise / my interpretation: it's useless to judge utility abstracted from context.

I suggest we separate our statements between definitions and experience reports.
A definition defines a concept as crisply as possible.
An experience report applies a set of definitions to a problem, shares the effects, and judges their desirability.

Don't push an abstraction on your friends without qualification.
You can only do that if you're a tyrant.
Don't be a tyrant.

Rather, when you want to introduce an abstraction, consider why it's useful.
Build up a nexus of examples.
Then ask your friends to judge for themselves.
