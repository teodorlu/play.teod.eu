#+TITLE: Effort asymmetry on the web

[[file:..][..]]

As the web fills with noise, us web individuals get used to it.
It creeps into our actions.
The entities we're chatting with, are they humans or spambots?
Suddenly, we're treating humans as spambots.

Open source is thankless work.
Sure, you may be successful enough to get some Internet likes, but those likes don't pay rent.
Those likes don't let you grow your tool used by thousands into something that can sustain itself.
Those likes can't hire people to help you make your thing.

The least we can do is treat open source maintainers with dignity.
Don't squander their time.
Try to see it from their side.
Say thank you.

To all the open source maintainers in the world, I salute you.
Thank you for your work.
