** Motivation
- To learn how computer memory works
- To learn how to write programs that use the memory effectively, to achieve better performance then when working with objects
- To learn how to work with big datasets
- Perhaps even learn some graphics.

Wait, I did write about this. What pages did I change most recently?

** More motivation
I could also learn Zig.
I kinda wanna learn Zig.
Learning Zig might give me most of the same benefits as learning C, but with less of the old baggage.
And simple build system and LSP and stuff.
