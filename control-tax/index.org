#+TITLE: The Control Tax

[[file:..][..]]

* Resource control
- Taxing use of the commons in order to maintain the commons
- Adding controlled interchange layers in order to measure and tax - pricing
  requires measurement, measurement requires control.
* Intent control
Jay author Jonathan blow on fragmented intent in open source:
because work is distributed among many minds, it's harder to get a cohesive vision (intent) for the future.
* Replace control with trust in order to remove the control tax
When we trust each other, we trust that others mean us well, and that their intents are worth pursuing.
That trust lets us drop our guard to the end that we don't need to uphold that control.
We don't have to pay the control tax.
