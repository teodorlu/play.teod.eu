DRAFT

A microtheory is a bite-sized definition + motivation for why this matters.
A microtheory is a good explanation.

Examples of microtheories:

- Cellular automata: https://snapshots.nextjournal.com/clerk-demo/build/f8112d44fa742cd0913dcbd370919eca249cbcd9/notebooks/rule_30.html
- Fourier series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=19s

To build ladders of knowledge, compose microtheories into knowledge playlists.
