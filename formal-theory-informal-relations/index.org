#+begin_quote
it's always interesting to me how often people try to "formalize" certain things that you can actually just do "informally". I'm personally generally of the opinion that things should be kept "informal" up to the edge of chaos.

Formalize /what/?

| what            | informal         | formal                     |
|-----------------+------------------+----------------------------|
| human relations | trust, warmth    | contracts, procedures      |
| math            | [[id:028a2171-3146-4fbc-8d5d-3209675dae8b][value in context]] | precision                  |
| software        | how is it used?  | how does it actually work? |

I'd like to encourage people to keep /human relations informal/.
That's a different thing than never being precise!
