#+TITLE: An Emacs Lisp rosetta for Clojurians

[[file:..][..]]

This document is aimed at Clojure programmers who want to learn some Emacs lisp.

* Looping for side effects

In Clojure, =map= and =for= are intended for iterating over pure functions.
They are lazy, and may never finish.

For side-effectful code, =doseq= is my goto.

Here's how we can print some numbers:

#+begin_src clojure :results output :exports both
(doseq [n (range 3)]
  (println (str  n "? No!!!")
           "You are not a number! You are a free man!"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0? No!!! You are not a number! You are a free man!
: 1? No!!! You are not a number! You are a free man!
: 2? No!!! You are not a number! You are a free man!
