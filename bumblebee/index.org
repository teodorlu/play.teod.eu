#+TITLE: Bumblebee

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

This libary does not yet exist.

*Idea*: wrap [[id:7b88332e-f8a7-452b-bfd8-d128728182ce][OpenFOAM]].
Aim for easy use with [[id:9799d27f-49d0-414a-bb94-f611588fc85c][Clerk]].
Provide a data language (avoid string manipulation), and convenience functions for showing fluid fields.

*Logo*: a determined bumblebee flying in strong headwind, with fluid flow lines showing turbulence and drag sources.
Consider asking Camilla if she's interested in helping draw something.

*Motivation*: as of 2023-03-20, I'm reading [[id:6b654acd-a9b6-493d-ba2b-399b574813a2][Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed]].
And I want to see, read, explore an interactive essay exploring the interplay of lift, drag and stealth on geometric bodies.
