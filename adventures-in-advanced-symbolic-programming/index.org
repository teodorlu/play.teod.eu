** really interesting exercises.
I've read read/skimmed the [[id:29d152b9-9f5e-4c23-904a-f926b3d83477][Software Design for Flexibility]], but I don't feel like I have more than a superficial understanding of the concepts presented.
Reading through the exercises for this course was interesting because they seemed significant and /hard/.
Good hard, not silly hard.
