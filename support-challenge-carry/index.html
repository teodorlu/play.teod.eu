<h2 id="what">what</h2>
<p>Support: How can I make others good, powerful?</p>
<p>Challenge: What information do I need to feed back into the system in
order for it to run smoother?</p>
<p>Carry: Is it time for me to lead?</p>
<p><strong>frame: carry and support in league of legends</strong>
Provide some examples, video.</p>
<p><strong>frame: carry and support in Age of Empires</strong>. More
examples!</p>
<p><strong>stepwise: support ➡ challenge ➡ carry</strong> Why? Because
playing support is easier – you don’t need to <em>define</em> the rules
of the game to play nice. But why is that? Because theory does not need
to precede practice! If you want to paint, paint. If you want to write,
write. If you want to build, build. To define the rules of the game is
to design theory. And designing good theory is <em>way</em> easier when
you can keep some application of that theory in mind.</p>
<p><strong>dynamic initiative</strong>. Who should carry? That depends
on who knows the territory better – what we’re doing now, and where
we’re going. As a team forms, its <a
href="../trust-quality-intent/">turst, shared sense of quality, and
shared intent</a> will improve. That lowers switching costs. Questions
&amp; framings that needs to be explicit early on takes hold in a shared
understanding. With lower switching cost, it makes sense to move the
initiative around. When the switching cost reaches zero, we want the
player with the best map to lead. But can we reach “perfection”? No. I
don’t believe that’s possible. There will <em>always</em> be information
asymmetry. The reason is plain: information asymmetry gives teams
leverage. Different people want different things.</p>
<p>Not: <em>perfect dynamic initiative</em>. But: <em>shared
understaning, charity and team willingness to support, challenge and
carry</em>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">examples</h2>
<p><strong>product lead, tech lead interaction</strong> I like to
program, and I like to create tools that actually work well in the real
world. Why? Programming, I just <em>like</em>. It’s a skill I like to
exercise. It’s something I like to <em>do</em>. It does come with
benefits.</p>
<p><strong>create optionality</strong>. Dynamic initiative is good
because it opens doors that are otherwise closed. When one person leads
and the rest follows, the followers are limited in how they can help
improve the system in a positive direction. When one person leads, the
only options are the options that the leader <em>sees</em>. And when the
leader acts, the leader cannot do <em>something else</em>. The leader is
busy.</p>
<p><strong>dynamic initiative optimized for learning speed</strong>. One
frame is that the best leader should lead. Another frame is that the one
best suited to learn from leading should lead. I suggest balancing the
two. But if you are the de-facto leader, consider whether you should
create space rather than push ahead right now. It might unveil things
you didn’t think of. It will enable you to put your attention elsewhere.
And the team member picking up the initiative might gain more than you
could ever imagine. Skills, obviously. But more importantly, ownership.
You <em>want</em> the team to take initiative towards your shared goal.
That will not happen in teams where direction is monopolized.</p>
<p><strong>start with support – but ask WHY.</strong>. When starting
out, play support. Ask how you can help, then try to help. Why? Because
that’s the most solid epistemic strategy. If you start out challenging,
you’ll be arguing to change something you don’t know what is. If you
start out carrying, you will be setting the rules for playing the game
without knowing what the goal of the game is. But <em>ask WHY</em>.
Don’t <em>just</em> follow along. You want to know why doing the thing
you’re doing makes sense. You want to <em>gradually</em> move towards
knowing with <a href="../value-in-context/">value in context</a> you’re
providing. You want to <a href="../learning-to-discover/">learn to
discover</a>. But you don’t need to put a ton of effort into that in the
beginning. You asked how you could help. What was the answer you got?
Did that answer make sense? After a week or two, does the initial answer
still make sense? Is it a part of some larger whole, or just some
gibberish someone made up? Consider challenging a bit!</p>
<p><strong>challenge around your expertise</strong>. As you get more
comfortable, challenge. And don’t challenge in a supid, denegrating way.
Don’t assume people are idiots, follow the <a
href="../principle-of-charity/">Principle of Charity</a>.</p>
<p><strong>then pick an option, and carry it</strong>. An option is
something you can capitalize on. A potential for value sometime in the
future. Why not help explore that option! Light your torch, and venture
into the unknown.</p>

<p>Why do I even care about this? Because I used to neglect support.</p>
