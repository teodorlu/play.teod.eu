#+TITLE: How to build ideas

[[file:..][..]]

Hello, world :)

Let's go to prod --- deploy takes about 30 seconds.

- apply [[id:c8131839-be8d-4ca8-8bc3-eac72cfade15][Capability, feature and assembly]] to product, development, design
- generalize to ideas

* Principles:

- Less than the minimal number of moving pieces is bad

* A good capability:

- The language exposed from the capability is well suited to describe the problems it solves for features.
- The capability interface has a minimal number of moving pieces
- The capaibility has minimal dependencies
- Exposes narrow names.
  - Narrow names are not too general, and not too specific.
- Exposed names fit well into the language of the consuming feature.
  - Reading the implementation is not required

* General value prop:
|            | What | For whom | What's good |
| Capability |      |          |             |
| Feature    |      |          |             |
| Assembly   |      |          |             |
* Specialized to product management
* Specialized to design
* Specialized to development
* Generalization - idea construction
