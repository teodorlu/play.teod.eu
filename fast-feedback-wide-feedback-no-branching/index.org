#+TITLE: Fast feedback, wide feedback, no branching

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

Ideal technical work. Covers "all development".

In combination with project management: limit WIP.

In combination with product management: we want to move the product in a direction that makes sense.
Fast feedback, wide feedback and no branching are technical properties.
When we work with products, we want to point the development in a direction that makes sense for the product.

| fast feedback   | feedback time less than 100 ms                                   |
| slow feedback   | feedback time more than 1 second                                 |
| wide feedback   | we're confident that our whole system works                      |
| narrow feedback | we're not sure whether we broke something                        |
| no branching    | there's one source of truth                                      |
| branching       | we're not sure which combination of branches we're talking about |
