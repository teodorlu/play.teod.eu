#+title: Modeling knowledge with RDF

[[./..][..]]

DRAFT

Intent: introduce RDF for knowledge modeling.

* Draft outline

1. Show Wikidata
   1. Show how to query with Wikidata
2. Show that RDF composes EASILY - in contrast to SQL
3. Consider applying it to play.teod.eu / garden.iterate.no / archipelago.iterate.no
4. Should I show RDF or datascript?
   1. I know datascript, so perhaps just use that.

* Why?

Better model for knowledge than SQL.
Provides a layer to /lay on top/ of normal articles.
Wikipedia --- RDF model (wikidata) drives tables that can be embedded in articles.
AND assets are also rich. Images are rich.

* Ramble

Do I need an intermediate layer between entities (articles) and assets?

Are links assets?

Are there other kinds of assets?

Should assets be queryable?

Batch readable, batch writeable?

Hmm
