Hi, I'm Steven. I like computers, problems and using the former to solve the latter. I believe in elegance over adequacy, thoughtfulness over impulse, and in the wonder of the world as we can see it. I like to build and design cool pieces of technology.

Throughout the years, I've left a trail of nifty contraptions behind, most of which are published here. You'll find demos, designs, dev journals and other random musings.
