#+title: My public journal

[[./..][..]]

Q: Hey! Should I read this?

A: Perhaps not. Perhaps. I use this page as a low-filter, low-threshold way to
get ideas out. Capture ideas, not process them. The reading experience might
feel like a stream-of-consciousness endeavor --- with less flow, less feelings,
less poetic content. In other words, messy, without the good sides of messy.
Still, I choose to make this public, because I believe public should be the
norm, not the exception.

** On product and indirection.
I feel shackled by pressure for specificity.
Always be specific.
Specific is better.
Don't be vague.

Specificity expels indirection.
Indirection is core to design.

If we lazer-focus on the specific, we'll ignore problems with a longer feedback
cycle time than some arbitrary limit.
