#+TITLE: Quantifying where my writing effort goes

[[file:..][..]]

DRAFT

I acquired a writing habit some time in 2017.

(Hmm, I kinda wanna graph my writing activity then too)

I started journaling in org-mode.

In the summer of 2020, Roam Research came along.
Some time later, I created a "personal channel" (#teod-play) on the company Slack server.

I want this

So ... I got sidetracked into writing some clojure code that shells out to git in order to do git stuff

In other words, let's shave the yaks.

** Lol, that went well.
I think my original idea was:

1. I want a time series plot of my activity
2. Separated by source:
   1. personal git & org-mode thing
   2. Roam Research
   3. here on play.teod.eu
