<p><em>Instead, let‚Äôs try ‚Äúnarrow opinions and good questions‚Äù.</em></p>
<h2 id="part-1---a-definition-of-knowledge">Part 1 - A definition of
knowledge</h2>
<p>‚ÄúStrong opinions‚Äù is an excuse for imprecise, sloppy thinking. Sloppy
thinking is bad. Don‚Äôt do it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? I think so. First, I propose a hierarchy of
knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge
<ul>
<li>Fact
<ul>
<li>Observation</li>
<li>Implication</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Judgement
<ul>
<li>Aphorism</li>
<li>Contextual utility</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>An observation is a record in time.</em> Observations are facts.
‚ÄúOn 2022-12-17, I saw a user struggle to understand how to navigate an
app I made‚Äù is an observation.</p>
<p><em>An implication connects cause and relation".</em> Implications
are facts. ‚ÄúIf we separate between mutable code and immutable code, we
derive a clean caching strategy for the immutable code‚Äù is an
implications. Another example is ‚ÄúWhen the user gets a login error,
there‚Äôs a fault in the system John is making‚Äù.</p>
<p>Facts can be invalidated. We can misremember events, or use sloppy
logic in our judgment. Facts are true or false, not good or bad.</p>
<p>In contrast, judgment is subjective. Before we continue, let‚Äôs put
what we‚Äôve defined in a table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>observation</td>
<td>Pete has such vast knowledge of Ukraine‚Äôs geography!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>implication</td>
<td>Ben is a smart guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>judgment</td>
<td>If you‚Äôre uncertain, ask Ann. She‚Äôs wise.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I want to split judgment into aphorism and contextual utility.</p>
<p><em>An aphorism is a deeply held belief</em>. It‚Äôs part of your
theory of the world. ‚ÄúDo: treat people with respect‚Äù is an aphorism.
Your aphorisms are shaped by your experience. Treating the people you
meet with respect is good for long term relationships, but it might
cause you harm in low trust environments. Yet, we humans are limited. We
don‚Äôt have complete rational control over our psychology. We should
accept that. Accept that we hold deep beliefs that we can‚Äôt change at a
whim.</p>
<p><em>Contextual utility is when you recognize a good thing to do in a
situation.</em> You‚Äôre able to recognize and match some situation to
potential actions, and pick one that makes sense. You ask a good follow
up question because you recognize the situation of your conversation
partner, have a hunch of where to move the conversation, and are able to
open up something that was previously fuzzy and unknown.</p>
<center>

</center>

<p>Phew. That was a lot. We‚Äôve got a bit further to go, please bear with
me. I promise that there‚Äôs a specific call to action at the end!</p>

<h2 id="part-2---so-what">Part 2 - So what?</h2>
<p>By talking more precisely about knowledge, we can build better stuff
together. So, where does ‚Äúbetter‚Äù fit into this hierarchy of knowledge?
Where‚Äôs the quality? That‚Äôs a great question, and I don‚Äôt have a precise
answer. I believe quality is both objective and subjective. It doesn‚Äôt
fit neatly into either of the four categories.. Rather, it ties them
together.</p>
<p>So, what should we do?</p>
<p>I started out claiming that ‚ÄúStrong opinions loosely held‚Äù is an
excuse for sloppy thinking. A strong opinion stands on its own, as a
whole. It is in part observation, in part implication, in part aphorism
and in part contextual utility. A big, monolithic opinion is hard to
criticize precisely. You either agree with it, or you don‚Äôt. When you‚Äôre
choosing to hold strong opinions, you‚Äôre putting the burden of pulling
your opinion apart on your conversational partner. I think that‚Äôs a bad
thing to do. And you can choose to <em>not do it</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, hold and present <em>narrow opinions</em>. Avoid depending
on your aphorisms when possible. When expressing contextual utility,
make the context explicit. Explain the situation in which you‚Äôre
suggesting your cause of action. Complex problems tend to require
observations, implications and contextual utility. Don‚Äôt lump all of
these together. Split them. By sharing your observations, others can
trust your perception, or present conflicting evidence. Your
implications can help others learn how you reason. When you‚Äôve split up
and recomposed your problem, end by asking questions to shape the
conversation. Help people help you by sharing where you‚Äôre uncertain.
Are you missing information? Is there a part of your suggested course of
action you‚Äôre not confident about? How can other people help you? Ask
about that. Then people can understand where you‚Äôre coming from, and how
they can help you.</p>
<p><em>How about you? You‚Äôre just perfectly doing this all the
time?</em> Not at all. This is an ideal! Precise thinking requires more
effort.</p>
<h2 id="part-3---write-shit-down.">Part 3 - write shit down.</h2>
<p>If you don‚Äôt make your thinking explicit, you won‚Äôt be able to look
at your thinking from the outside. Explicit thinking is exactly what you
get when you write down what you think. You disconnect from the react to
what‚Äôs happening right now loop. You can revisit your thoughts at a
later point in time, and see if you still believe what you wrote.</p>
<p>Let compassion for others motivate you when you write. You should
care about your target audience. At least if you‚Äôre going to solve hard
problems together. Take your time to disassemble your ball of ideas
before you attempt to shove it into other people‚Äôs heads. Or be precise
in what you‚Äôre asking for. ‚ÄúYou should do as I say‚Äù is a very different
thing to ask for than ‚ÄúCan you help me disentangle this problem I can‚Äôt
get my head around?‚Äù</p>
<p>Writing is caring.</p>
